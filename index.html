    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, I am doing my Master's at both Aalto University and KTH,
        studying the Erasmus double degree programme in Security and Cloud Computing (<a href="https://secclo.eu" target="_blank">SECCLO</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        During the Spring semester of 2021, I live in Helsinki, where I am writing my Master's thesis with the <a href="https://ssg.aalto.fi" target="_blank">Secure Systems Group</a> at Aalto University.
        My thesis concerns research into attack-tolerant execution environments (in the context of speculative execution side-channel attacks).
