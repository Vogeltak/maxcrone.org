    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
    	I recently started at <a href="https://brightcomputing.com" target="_blank">Bright Computing</a> in Amsterdam as a Linux developer,
	where I'm helping to build state-of-the-art cluster management software that runs and co√∂perates well with a plethora of hardware and software systems.

    <p>
    	I'm also learning to call Amsterdam my new home for a while.
	Playing Ultimate frisbee with many different people, exploring film houses, book shops, restaurants, and so many of Amsterdam's other treasures.
