    <p>Hi! I am a twenty-two year old human from The Netherlands.</p>
    <p>
        I have been studying computer science and computer security in The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden.
        You can read more about my story <a href="/about">here</a>.

    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, I am doing my Master's at both Aalto University and KTH,
        studying the Erasmus double degree programme in Security and Cloud Computing (<a href="https://secclo.eu" target="_blank">SECCLO</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Stockholm is where I live now, while I study at KTH this semester.
        I am working on a project comparing flow classification methods in load balancers together with five other students, supervised by <a href="https://www.tombarbette.be/">Tom Barbette</a>.
        Next to this, I follow a course on Ethical Hacking, which is basically one big CTF.
