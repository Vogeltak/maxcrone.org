			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>
				I am a Computer Science student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tue.nl">TU/e</a> (Eindhoven University of Technology) with interests in security and privacy of computer networks.
				Recently I was admitted to the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's programme <a target="_blank" href="https://secclo.eu/">SECCLO</a> (Security and Cloud Computing), thus I will be furthering my development in Finland soon.
				I was awarded the HAIC scholarship as partial funding for SECCLO.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the TU/e I have been part of the Honors Society, focusing on competitive programming and problem solving.
				In 2016 I was awarded the Socrates International Honour Society recognition of excellence.
				I am also a member of the IEEE, Computer Society and Internet Society organizations.
