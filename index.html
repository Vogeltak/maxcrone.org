    <p>Hi! I am a twenty-two year old human from The Netherlands.</p>
    <p>
        I have been studying computer science and computer security in The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden.
        You can read more about my story <a href="/about">here</a>.

    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, I am doing my Master's at both Aalto University and KTH,
        studying the Erasmus double degree programme in Security and Cloud Computing (<a href="https://secclo.eu" target="_blank">SECCLO</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        This summer I am also working as an intern with the Network Security Research team at Ericsson in Finland.
        There, I am working on an implementation of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-emu-eap-noob/" target="_blank">EAP-NOOB</a>, a method that enables secure bootstrapping of IoT devices.
