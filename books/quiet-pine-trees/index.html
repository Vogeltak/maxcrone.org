<section class="post-content">
    <p>There are truly inspiring gems of microfiction in here, but reading them in book form is a shallow exercise.
They are clearly meant for microblogging platforms, where they intersperse one's other countless number of toots and tweets as welcome nuggets of fantasy.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I want to reproduce a few of them here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plants raised in space produced nutrients that would silence the panic of being so deep in the deadly void.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rich didn't do their own dreaming; they hired technicians to create dreams for them.
Every day teams of experts wrote flattering narrative so their corrupt employers could feel like heroes for a few hours each night.
It soothed the conscience without the need to repent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We mastered antigravity, but the technology polluted our water.
Rivers soared into the sky, and oceans flowed upward into mountain ranges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moths mistake light bulbs for the extinct copper-lily, which grew by concentrating grounded lightning.
To this day, hummingbirds still run on sips of nectar taken before the last blossom shorted out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By popular vote, cold weather was cancelled.
Lavender snow fell on green fields that winter, carried by hot winds.
Our breath still hung in the air as sticky-sweet dew.
Society had little tolerance for those who longed for the vanishing cold.
Soon the old seasons were forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>
