    <p>I had to read it just to finish the arc that started in high school, but it will be my last Sanderson book.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Why did <em>Wind and truth</em> feel like such a dilemma to me?</p>
<p>On the one hand I found all characters to be one-dimensional, none of the plot lines were going in directions that made sense, and the style of writing was uninspired.
The worldbuilding that people hail Brandon for was severely lacking too.
No interesting new people, derivative locations; even the "exploration" plot line with Kaladin and Szeth was paper thin on the actual worldbuilding and interaction with the environment and its inhabitants.
The only engaging worldbuilding happened in visions from the past, about dead people (and some heralds).
This book instead spent many of its pages having characters do "introspection", which was mostly very heavy-handed and literal projecting in some sort of ethically authoritative narrative voice.
To approximate moral and emotional depth, Brandon literally has characters "think" about how complicated their feelings are.
Every single page enforced the criticisms from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230723125646/https://www.wired.com/story/brandon-sanderson-is-your-god/">2023 Wired profile</a> on Brandon Sanderson.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I often <em>wanted</em> to pick up the book to continue reading.
Something kept pulling me back.
More strongly than some of the more beautiful books I've read.
And I ended up reading through the whole thirteen-hundred-and-twenty-nine pages in my American edition pretty quickly in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>Online reviews were pretty ruthless too.
Roughly falling into two buckets.
Either people really hated how 21st-century-Disney-woke Brandon's writing had become (oh no, <em>gay</em> people having a romantic relationship).
Or they just generally had come to realize that Brandon's writing is pretty mediocre.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brandon Sanderson has supplanted Jonah Hill as the worst therapy guy in existence.</p>
<p>Predictions for book 6: Kaladin creates the DSM and establishes cognitive behavioral therapy as the Cosmere standard of care for mental health. Sanderson anachronistically uses the word ‘delulu’ in reference to Shallan. Odium realizes his problems stem from his relationship with his father and seeks to do better. Szeth’s journey of self-fulfillment continues and he and nightblood start a wellness podcast.</p>

<p>sanderson, i'm begging you, on my knees, pleading with you, PLEASE hire another editor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dune Chapter 1 in the style of Brandon Sanderson:</p>
<p>Paul Atreides was sweating.</p>
<p>What <em>time</em> was it? Ah, yes, it was a week… a week before … before … what <em>exactly</em>?</p>
<p><em>In one week we are leaving for Arrakis</em>, he thought. <em>They also call it Dune. But I was born on Caladan.</em></p>
<p>The room was hot. He held his Breath.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t there supposed to be some old woman coming to visit mother today?</em></p>
<p>It was warm. He was at the Castle. Castle Caladan, it was called. It was a pile of Stone. Yet it was his home.</p>
<p><em>26 years now. No…</em> 26 generations.</p>
<p>The old woman came in. She entered Paul’s room and looked at Paul. Paul was lying in his bed. She looked at him, thinking he was sleeping. She stood before his mother, looking like a witch, her hair looking like spiderwebs. Her eyes looked like jewels.</p>
<p>“He is so <em>small</em>, Jessica”, she said. “Are we <em>sure</em> he is fifteen? Maybe in dog years”, the old woman mused.</p>
<p>“What is a dog?”, Jessica asked.</p>
<p>“Nevermind”, the old woman said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well this was horrible, but at least I'm finally free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a beautiful long <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7075198574">rant</a> by Стефан (3/5).</p>
<p>So, I recognize that it might just be because of me.
Most people who've read the book seem to be pretty positive about it.
Maybe my tastes have just shifted away from the mass-market fantasy entertainment genre.</p>
