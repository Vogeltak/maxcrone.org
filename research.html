    <h2>Attack-tolerant trusted execution environments</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-07-12-attack-tolerant-trusted-execution-environments.pdf">PDF</a> — 2021</p>
    <p>
		This is my Master's thesis, completed at Aalto University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in the Spring semester of 2021.
		I worked in the <a href="https://ssg.aalto.fi" target="_blank">Secure Systems Group</a> at Aalto University, together with an amazing group of other researchers.
		My thesis explores the effects of confidentiality compromise of trusted execution environments (think about Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone) and how to still perform remote attestation while guaranteeing integrity protection.
		Start by reading the abstract below.
    </p>
    <p>
  		In recent years, trusted execution environments (TEEs) have seen increasing deployment in computing devices
  		to protect security-critical software from run-time attacks and provide isolation from an untrustworthy operating system (OS).
  		A trusted party verifies the software that runs in a TEE using remote attestation procedures.
  		However, the publication of transient execution attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown
  		revealed fundamental weaknesses in many TEE architectures, including Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone.
  		These attacks can extract cryptographic secrets, thereby compromising the integrity of the remote attestation procedure.

  		In this work, we design and develop a TEE architecture that provides remote attestation integrity protection
  		even when confidentiality of the TEE is compromised.
  		We use the formally verified seL4 microkernel to build the TEE, which ensures strong isolation and integrity.
  		We offload cryptographic operations to a secure co-processor that does not share any vulnerable microarchitectural
  		hardware units with the main processor, to protect against transient execution attacks.
  		Our design guarantees integrity of the remote attestation procedure.
  		It can be extended to leverage co-processors from Google and Apple, for wide-scale deployment on mobile devices.

    <h2>Multi-core flow classification methods for load balancing</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-01-07-multi-core-flow-classification.pdf">PDF</a> — 2021</p>
    <p>
        This document is the product of a semester-long group project with the Network Systems lab at KTH, Stockholm.
        We implemented flow tables that scale to multiple cores, and thoroughly evaluated their performance.
        The report provides the results as a detailed comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked with the <a href="https://github.com/tbarbette/fastclick">FastClick</a> framework for composing network functions, and used the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) underneath for packet processing in user space.
        Traffic generation was built using <a href="https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/">TRex</a>.

    <h2>Adoptability of secure BGP routing proposals</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-02-01-secure-bgp-adoption.pdf">PDF</a> — 2021</p>
    <p>
    	This article stems from a research seminar on the insecurity of BGP routing and the proposed solutions to secure the infrastructure.
	The current internet's routing system is unauthenticated, which has lead to large BGP hijacking, interception, and AS path forgery attacks.
	I investigated the different approaches to securing BGP routing, and tried to identify concrete metrics to predict their adoptability.
	This area is a fascinating intersection of technology and distributed policy, by the unique nature of the internet.

    <h2>Protocols for issuing and managing digital certificates</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2020-certificate-management-protocols.pdf">PDF</a> — 2020</p>
    <p>
        Digital certificates have become an essential part of secure communication.
        Besides the internet, certificates are used in industrial and Internet of Things settings.
        The increase in usage of certificates calls for effective ways to manage them.
        This paper overviews three standardized certificate management protocols and discusses the extent of their deployment and use.
        In addition, the paper addresses extensions to these protocols and their role in the Internet of Things.

    <h2>An analysis of the YouTube CDN</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2019-youtube-cdn-analysis.pdf">PDF</a> — 2019</p>
    <p>
        This report is a research into the video distribution
        and caching strategies employed by YouTube. We collect data
        from multiple continents for a multitude of videos. Our analyses
        find geolocations of cache servers used by YouTube, measure
        their performance and interpret the cache host names. Our data
        did not support any clear strategy based on time of the week or
        region, with the exception of the case for uploading a video, in
        which the region of upload had a clear advantage for the first
        hour after publishing compared to other regions. We conclude
        by formulating our expectation that the distribution and caching
        in YouTube’s infrastructure is currently largely governed by
        machine learning models and therefore our research could not
        find a clearly discernible strategy

    <h2>Investigations into adaptive streaming and live streaming performance</h2>
    <p>
        This work was again written together with <a href="https://blog.cubieserver.de/" target="_blank">Jack Henschel</a>,
        and consists of two separate papers.
    </p>
    <h3>Adaptive streaming</h3>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2019-adaptive-streaming-analysis.pdf">PDF</a> — 2019</p>
    <p>
        In this report we investigate the behaviour of Adaptive
        Bitrate Streaming with the DASH protocol under different
        network conditions with regard to video quality and fairness
        between clients. We found that the adaption to static and
        changing network conditions works quite well to always provide
        clients with the highest possible video quality while minimizing
        buffering delays.
    </p>
    <h3>Live streaming latency</h3>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2019-livestreaming-latency-analysis.pdf">PDF</a> — 2019</p>
    <p>
        In this report we set up a live streaming server using
        a combination of stateless and stateful protocols, based on which
        we evaluate the performance of these different protocols with
        regards to latency. As expected, we find that a stateful protocol
        like RTMP has the lowest latency while suffering from scalability
        limitations. Stateless protocols, such as HLS and DASH, exhibit
        a higher latency but are easier to scale, e.g. by using a CDN
        which we also analyzed. Specific fine-tuning of the streaming
        parameters for the stateless protocols is found to bring down
        their end-to-end-latency.
