    <h2>Multi-core flow classification methods for load balancing</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-01-07-multi-core-flow-classification.pdf">Final 63-page report</a></p>
    <p>
        This document is the product of a semester-long group project with the Network Systems lab at KTH, Stockholm.
        We implemented flow tables that scale to multiple cores, and thoroughly evaluated their performance.
        The report provides the results as a detailed comparison.

        I worked with the <a href="https://github.com/tbarbette/fastclick">FastClick</a> framework for composing network functions, and used the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) underneath for packet processing in user space.
        Traffic generation was built using <a href="https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/">TRex</a>.

    <h2>Adoptability of secure BGP routing proposals</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-02-01-secure-bgp-adoption.pdf">PDF</a></p>
    <p>
    	This article stems from a research seminar on the insecurity of BGP routing and the proposed solutions to secure the infrastructure.
	The current internet's routing system is unauthenticated, which has lead to large BGP hijacking, interception, and AS path forgery attacks.
	I investigated the different approaches to securing BGP routing, and tried to identify concrete metrics to predict their adoptability.
	This area is a fascinating intersection of technology and distributed policy, by the unique nature of the internet.
