    <h2>Attack-tolerant trusted execution environments</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-07-12-attack-tolerant-trusted-execution-environments.pdf">PDF</a></p>
    <p>
		This is my Master's thesis, completed at Aalto University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in the Spring semester of 2021.
		I worked in the <a href="https://ssg.aalto.fi" target="_blank">Secure Systems Group</a> at Aalto University, together with an amazing group of other researchers.
		My thesis explores the effects of confidentiality compromise of trusted execution environments (think about Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone) and how to still perform remote attestation while guaranteeing integrity protection.
		Start by reading the abstract below.
    </p>
    <p>
  		In recent years, trusted execution environments (TEEs) have seen increasing deployment in computing devices
  		to protect security-critical software from run-time attacks and provide isolation from an untrustworthy operating system (OS).
  		A trusted party verifies the software that runs in a TEE using remote attestation procedures.
  		However, the publication of transient execution attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown
  		revealed fundamental weaknesses in many TEE architectures, including Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone.
  		These attacks can extract cryptographic secrets, thereby compromising the integrity of the remote attestation procedure.

  		In this work, we design and develop a TEE architecture that provides remote attestation integrity protection
  		even when confidentiality of the TEE is compromised.
  		We use the formally verified seL4 microkernel to build the TEE, which ensures strong isolation and integrity.
  		We offload cryptographic operations to a secure co-processor that does not share any vulnerable microarchitectural
  		hardware units with the main processor, to protect against transient execution attacks.
  		Our design guarantees integrity of the remote attestation procedure.
  		It can be extended to leverage co-processors from Google and Apple, for wide-scale deployment on mobile devices.

    <h2>Multi-core flow classification methods for load balancing</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-01-07-multi-core-flow-classification.pdf">PDF</a></p>
    <p>
        This document is the product of a semester-long group project with the Network Systems lab at KTH, Stockholm.
        We implemented flow tables that scale to multiple cores, and thoroughly evaluated their performance.
        The report provides the results as a detailed comparison.

        I worked with the <a href="https://github.com/tbarbette/fastclick">FastClick</a> framework for composing network functions, and used the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) underneath for packet processing in user space.
        Traffic generation was built using <a href="https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/">TRex</a>.

    <h2>Adoptability of secure BGP routing proposals</h2>
    <p class="document"><a href="/assets/docs/2021-02-01-secure-bgp-adoption.pdf">PDF</a></p>
    <p>
    	This article stems from a research seminar on the insecurity of BGP routing and the proposed solutions to secure the infrastructure.
	The current internet's routing system is unauthenticated, which has lead to large BGP hijacking, interception, and AS path forgery attacks.
	I investigated the different approaches to securing BGP routing, and tried to identify concrete metrics to predict their adoptability.
	This area is a fascinating intersection of technology and distributed policy, by the unique nature of the internet.
