        This document is the product of a semester-long group project during my time at KTH, Stockholm.
        We implemented flow tables that scale to multiple cores, and thoroughly evaluated their performance.
        The report provides the results as a detailed comparison.

        I worked with the <a href="https://github.com/tbarbette/fastclick">FastClick</a> framework for composing network functions, and used the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) underneath for packet processing in user space.
        Traffic generation was built using <a href="https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/">TRex</a>.
