<section class="post-content">
    <p>My semester of exchange experience in Stockholm was backdropped by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Luckily, the Swedish approach allowed me plenty of freedom.
Even though there were no lectures on campus, I was able to visit museums, restaurants, and generally walk through the beautiful city.
I had picked up a new camera, and Stockholm proved to be a fantastic place for developing my street photography.</p>
<p>The following is a small selection of twelve images I took during my time in Stockholm, to form a short, narrative introduction to how I have experienced the largest Nordic city.
I will offer some words in between, to expand on the mood or happenings of an image.</p>

<p class="picture-subscript">Day view of Stockholm on one of my walks.</p>
<p>This might actually be my favorite image of Stockholm.
The street view it presents through a blurry facade of greenery speaks precisely to how I experienced the city.
The buildings, their roofs — matte and colored, the broad and impeccable roads.
Shortly after arriving in Sweden, I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki&#x27;s_Delivery_Service">Kiki's delivery service</a> by Miyazaki, in which the city is modeled after Stockholm.
Ever since, any sight of Stockholm gave me the magical Ghibli sentiments.
But this image exemplifies that the best for me.</p>

<p>Despite the pandemic, the people of Stockholm didn't leave the streets to be post-apocalyptic wastelands, like in so many other cities around the world.
Especially during late summer, this provided me with ample opportunity to practice street photography.
I have been building up courage in photographing people on the streets, and ultimately also taking portraits of them.
The following three pictures form a small "people of Stockholm" sub-collection.
There are, however, many and many more pictures I took of people.
I might publish them some time in the future.</p>

<p>Nordic winters are extremely understimulating when there isn't any snow to be seen yet.
The days become a gray blur, and darkness becomes increasingly insistent.
The nights then start to become a more interesting playing field — especially in a larger city such as Stockholm, with its many lamps and leds — because of the contrasts between light and darkness.
There were plenty of nights where I went out to peacefully walk and observe.
The following three images provide a small glimpse.</p>

<p>The last three pictures sum up the meditative simplicities of life that I learned to appreciate more, in keeping my sanity during the pandemic-riddled semester.
Ultimately, talking and working with friends makes my life fulfilling.</p>
