<p class="picture-subscript">Tunisian lablabi with eggs in my apartment in Helsinki, 2021.</p>
<p>Just stumbled upon this dish while browsing Wikipedia for other food-related reasons.
It seemed like a great option for a weekday meal, because of its simplicity in preparation and ingredients.
Especially because I had some dough for flatbread left over, with which I had to be baking anyway this night.
The dish is simple enough that you can figure out what to do based on the single paragraph on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lablabi">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional recipe calls for harissa, a more spicy/herby hot chili pepper sauce.
Finnish supermarkets haven't heard of it yet though, so I got some sambal oelek (a plain, hot chili pepper sauce) and layered my own spices on top.</p>
<p>Start by frying plenty of garlic, sambal oelek, cumin, and coriander in olive oil.
Stir around such that they release all their fragrance.
Throw in a can of chickpeas with their liquid (if it isn't brined in salt), and pour in a good splash of water.
We are looking for a liquidy, garlic-cumin-chili broth situation.
Bring everything to a boil, stir a few times, and then crack in some eggs.
We will be poaching them in the sauce, until they are just soft enough.</p>
<p>Tear apart some of the fresh flatbreads (or stale breads, as the recipe seems to call for; it truly is a cheap man's way of eating) and dunk it in the dish.
Serve in a large bowl, with fresh parsley, lemon, more olive oil, and some flatbreads on the side.</p>
