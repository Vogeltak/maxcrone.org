                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In which I start with an informal list of the journalism I enjoy, before I realize that this shared obsession is what I love so much about my father.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve just watched the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_New_Yorker_at_100&quot;&gt;Netflix documentary&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; 100th anniversary.
And though the style of the film arguably doesn&#x27;t fit with &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; itself all that well, the characters that make up the various staff and contributing writers at the magazine are fascinating.
It renewed my slumbering dream of working as an investigative journalist myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been periods in my life where I read &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; more rigorously.
While living on the Otaniemi campus in Finland, for example, where the delivery of the print issues has actually been the most robust compared to all other addresses where I&#x27;ve had it delivered since then.
&lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has unmistakably played a role in my developing sense for journalistic quality.
Though as a European reader, much of it is less interesting than it would be to someone growing up in New Jersey and watching across the river with awe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other publications of high quality I&#x27;ve taken to reading more over the past few years.
Of course there are the various daily newspapers that allow their journalists to write some good investigative or background pieces from time to time.
Here in The Netherlands, I&#x27;d think of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volkskrant.nl&#x2F;&quot;&gt;De Volkskrant&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nrc.nl&#x2F;&quot;&gt;NRC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trouw.nl&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Trouw&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parool.nl&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Het Parool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Across the border; &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lemonde.fr&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Le Monde&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
(By no means an attempt at being comprehensive, just a personal reading history.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my preference actually lies with publications that appear less frequently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had been subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.groene.nl&quot;&gt;De Groene Amsterdammer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for sixty years and I&#x27;m determined to continue that tradition.
&lt;em&gt;De Groene&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; will actually be celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2027; outdoing &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.groene.nl&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;de-groene-amsterdammer-podcast&#x2F;afleveringen&#x2F;xandra-schutte-in-gesprek-met-de-hoofdredacteur-c64d3e01-d65f-4c5d-ab24-9925ddfcdcb1&quot;&gt;a wink&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
My father was also impressed to see me reading &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mondediplo.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Le Monde diplomatique&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; one day, until he realized it was the English edition.
That paper still served me well for a few years though.
It publishes incredible journalism that cuts deep through the complexities of the modern, interconnected world to attempt an analysis of its workings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remember an afternoon where my father and I attempted to solve the issue numbering mystery of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newleftreview.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;New Left Review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I&#x27;d been reading recent issues numbered in the vicinity of old issues that he still had lying around and had dug up for me to take a look at.
Then we realized that NLR had just reset the counter at some point; not all too dissimilar to countries trying to combat hyperinflation.
The joys of a new millennium.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more recently I&#x27;ve been enjoying the long reads in &quot;genre&quot; magazines like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nybooks.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lrb.co.uk&quot;&gt;London Review of Books&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
While in Vietnam last August, I browsed through the archives of &lt;em&gt;The New York Review&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; all the way back to the sixties and seventies to read through the essays about Vietnam.
Some &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nybooks.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;1967&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;report-from-vietnam-i-the-home-program&#x2F;&quot;&gt;beautiful writing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Mary McCarthy.
It&#x27;s in that same era that my father first awoke his own political consciousness.
Being swept up in the youth movements protesting American imperialism.
He started producing and illegally putting up wall newspapers in Leiden and Tilburg.
Reading the journalism from those years myself made me feel especially close to my father.
When I showed him some of the stories and sent him pictures from the war remnants museum in Ho Chi Minh City, my father replied with a photo of a &lt;em&gt;New Left Review&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;  magazine from 1968 (March-April) he had dug up from his own archives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father&#x27;s obsession with newspapers and journalism is what helped my own passion for this medium bloom.
It had started even earlier, actually, when alongside the &lt;em&gt;Donald Duck&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; we also had a subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kidsweek.nl&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kidsweek&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I was probably around eight or nine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the death of my father last month, these memories have become even more meaningful.
Our shared love for journalism, the important anti-establishment stories, and the pieces envisioning a fairer world relieved from the horrors of capitalism.
These will form one of the core pillars for when I remember my father in the future and whenever I pass on his memory to others.
This was a treasured part of his life.
And now it continues to be one in mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Didn&#x27;t hit the same spot as his yearly letters.
Less sense of wonder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved reading the yearly letters &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danwang.co&quot;&gt;Dan Wang&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; published on his website when he still worked for Gavekal Dragonomics (a fascinating company that employs a bunch of smart people to observe and think and then write their distilled thoughts down for investments firms to consume as signals).
That was when I still lived in Finland.
I remember lounging on the university campus in a harsh winter, reading Dan&#x27;s vivid descriptions of the Yunnan mountains and its cuisine.
Or how people from Shanghai have a different view of China compared to people from Beijing.
These letters filled me with a sense of wonder for this significant share of the world&#x27;s population that&#x27;s too large and diverse to truly comprehend.
Billions of Chinese people over the course of time.
In many cases arguably literally a different world.
And the yearly letters tried to dig deeper than anything I&#x27;d ever read about China before.
They didn&#x27;t just talk about whatever shallow procedural thing happened recently without ever taking the time to attempt to convey understanding of the systems and the traditions and the people behind all of what&#x27;s happening on the surface.
The letters were a distillation-in-progress in human life real-time of Dan&#x27;s understanding of the different powers at play, their historical context, their personalities, and how all of that could explain what&#x27;s happening in this country.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the food.
Parts of Dan&#x27;s letters are dedicated to his exploration of the different cuisines in China.
He goes by provinces, mostly.
But I&#x27;ve also seen it classified into the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chinese_regional_cuisine#Eight_Great_Traditions&quot;&gt;Eight Great Traditions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinesecookingdemystified.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;63-chinese-cuisines-the-complete&quot;&gt;sixty-three&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Chinese cuisines.
And though his descriptions are minimal, I find them to be irresistible.
From the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danwang.co&#x2F;2022-letter&#x2F;&quot;&gt;2022 letter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can describe Yunnan cuisine only through dishes special to me. I think of pickled bamboo shoots, gently fried, lending their funky sourness to fish soups. I think of ham, sometimes steamed on its own, sometimes sautéd with some chili peppers, sometimes dropped in the pot to enliven a broth. I think of whole stems of flowers, tossed with vinegar in salad. I think of various types of rice noodles, in thick strings like Udon or as thumb-sized slices, which are more supple-bodied and offer greater chewiness than noodles made of wheat. I think of simple farm cheeses — a rare find in Chinese culinary traditions — steamed with slices of ham. I think of spicy pickles, indiscriminately sharpening the flavors of noodle soups or a vegetable dish, say a quick fry of lotus root. I think of yellow strips of pea pudding, tossed in chili oil, vinegar, and some bean sprouts. I think of a simple lunch of rice cakes fried with ham, eggs, and chives. I think of stewed beef garnished with handfuls of fresh mint, of mashed potatoes that do not drown in butter but are suffused with salty pickles, and of simple pans of soup that have up to a half-dozen types of dark, leafy greens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most of all about mushrooms, which are the pride and glory of Yunnan. Mushrooms are still too smart for us to tame in greenhouses, so the best are foraged in the wild during the rainy months of the summer. The best types offer mesmerizing combinations of flavor and mouthfeel. Their flavors tend to be best with a light sauté, combined with chili peppers for a jaunty kick, and ham slices if need be. My favorite is the Ganba, found only under pine trees, which release so much gorgeous savoriness that it can suffuse a whole plate of rice with its musk when fried.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all of my positive associations with Dan&#x27;s writing, I was properly excited for his book.
Especially since he described it as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t write a letter last year. Rather, I wrote seven&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after having read the book, I&#x27;m slightly disappointed.
The appeal of the yearly letters was precisely that they struck the right balance between in-the-middle-of-it and distilled conclusion.
Partly stream-of-consciousness, but on the scale of a year.
For this book to work, it needed a simple and clear premise.
Dan found one, and I&#x27;m sure it took much thinking to verbalize all the arguments, but I feel it cheapens the discussion.
Where the letters have a sort of humble self-awareness about only ever being able to scratch the surface despite going relatively deep, the book must speak confidently on a theory of contrast born from dimensionality reduction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#x27;s its main premise: China is an engineering state to its own detriment, and the US is a lawyerly society to its detriment.
And Dan &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danwang.co&#x2F;breakneck&#x2F;&quot;&gt;acknowledges&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the simplified nature of it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering state versus the lawyerly society is not a grand theory to explain absolutely everything about the U.S. and China. Rather, the book is rooted in my own experiences of living in China from 2017 to 2023. I offer this framework to make sense of the recent past and think about what might come next.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the book to become a book, all of the chapters had to be written in order to support this theory.
Despite that, I still found some to be quite strong.
The chapter on the One Child policy was ruthless and gave me a much better understanding of it.
And there were luckily still mouthwatering descriptions of Chinese food sprinkled throughout.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two diagnoses Dan leaves us with in the final pages make for an apt summary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Communist Party is too afraid of the Chinese people to give them real agency.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States is unambitious; it has lost its ability to build and to govern.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The danger, he warns, is that this digital mythmaking can convince a generation to accept authoritarianism as normal, overlooking the real costs to democracy, peace and development. “This is not just about fake videos or social media hype,” Folahanmi said. “It’s about the rewriting of political reality in ways that threaten the future of the continent.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Kwangu Liwewe and Alec D&#x27;Angelo, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newlinesmag.com&#x2F;reportage&#x2F;africas-ai-strongmen&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Africa&#x27;s AI strongmen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, New Lines Magazine&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece feels like a premonition of what the abundance of generative AI will lead to in politics across the world.
But in this case, it&#x27;s already happening in African military dictatorships.
&quot;Digital mythmaking&quot; as a description of this phenomenon feels like such a good term for this new form of propaganda.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Four ways to forgiveness</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/books/four-ways-to-forgiveness/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Very good collection where all four stories are loosely but tastefully interconnected.
One of Ursula&#x27;s most powerful themes remains the fight against slavery and patriarchy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to be more precise, how the abolishment of slavery often causes women to be forced into the work that might have previously been done by enslaved people.
Or how a formal ban on slavery doesn&#x27;t end the suffering.
Ursula explores the myriad of ways that the injustices can continue.
And by exposing them so plainly, though on fictional worlds, criticizes our supposedly equal society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are themes throughout Ursula&#x27;s work, but in the four stories on Werel and Yeowe they are particularly immediate and pungent.
The first page of my edition has a few endorsements, with this one from Newsweek arguably capturing Ursula well:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin... wields her pen with a moral and psychological sophistication
rarely seen in science fiction circles, and while science fiction techniques
often buttress her stories they rarely take them over.
What she really does is write fables; splendidly intricate and hugely imaginative
tales about such mundane concerns as life, death, love, and sex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Ursula also does really well are stories that span a character&#x27;s full life.
Her interest doesn&#x27;t only start when a character is mature enough for whatever heroic feats are really what a writer wanted to write about.
No, Ursula&#x27;s fascination might be on the exact opposite side, where humans have grown frail of body, but wisely mild of mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;betrayals&quot;&gt;Betrayals&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula remains sublime in telling stories about older people.
(Literally left behind on another world.)
The immediate story is a simple one, but only possible by backdropping it with stories of their past lives, stories, and sins.
The story of forgiveness isn&#x27;t possible without having made mistakes in the past.
The cold, the simple house, and life; all are told so beautifully!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgiveness-day&quot;&gt;Forgiveness day&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solly, the privileged, space-faring Ekumen emissary, is posted with a society that is on its best behavior while trialing admittance to the intergalactic organization.
But this society remains strangely separated between men and women, and owners and assets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the officials and courtiers and businessmen she talked to on the business of the Ekumen did the best they could: they treated her as if she were a man.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solly moves as if immune or above this social regime, until she gets abducted and humbled, together with her security guard, who is a veteran from a completely different planet (Yeowe).
The politics and the diplomacy and the bureaucracy all feel so real, much more so than regular bombastic space operas that might take an order of magnitude more pages only to never achieve a similar level of immersion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-man-of-the-people&quot;&gt;A man of the people&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many different ways of inequality and how women remain slaves in society even after slavery itself is outlawed.
It also remains fascinating how there are never &quot;heroes&quot;, only flawed people, in Ursula&#x27;s works.
And they also meaningfully learn and change.
And actually seem to live actual lives, even when they are privileged Ekumenical sub-envoys.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&#x27;t think we can win freedom for ourselves alone by ourselves alone.
There has to be a change.
The men think they have to be bosses.
They have to stop thinking that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-woman-s-liberation&quot;&gt;A woman&#x27;s liberation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story that touched me the most.
Incredibly well written, maybe more a novella than a short story.
It&#x27;s the story of Rakam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an ordinary woman, but I have lived in years of mighty changes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep returning to this conclusion, but Ursula remains the best at telling the life story of a human, even though this one only goes until Rakam is thirty years old, and then tells the rest in a single page.
The story is one very similar to the history of slavery in our world.
From the abolition of slavery to further repression by plantation owners as sharecroppers.
And then to women-led revolutions; understudied and underappreciated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody in the compound obeyed the council of the grandmothers.
But if one of them went too far, the Bosses would have her flogged or blinded or her hands cut off.
When I was a young child, there lived in our compound a woman we called Great-Grandmother, who had holes for eyes and no tongue.
I thought that she was thus because she was so old.
I feared that my grandmother Dosse&#x27;s tongue would wither in her mouth.
She said, &quot;No. It won&#x27;t get any shorter, because I don&#x27;t let it get too long.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I loved to learn was history.
I had grown up without any history.
There was nothing at Shomeke or Zeskra but the way things were.
Nobody knew anything about any time when things had been different.
Nobody knew there was any place where things might be different.
We were enslaved by the present time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Teaching!&quot; Dr. Yeron said. &quot;A teacher! Oh, woman, you are rain to the dry land!&quot;
Indeed the first school I talked to wanted to hire me at once, to teach anything I wanted.
Because I come of a capitalist people, I went to other schools to see if I could make more money at them.
But I came back to the first one.
I liked the people there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignorance defends itself savagely, and illiteracy, as I well know, can be shrewd.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Literacy is irrelevant,&quot; one of our group said sorrowfully.
&quot;The chiefs have jumped right over our heads into the postliterate information technology.&quot;
I brooded over that, hating her fancy words, irrelevant, postliterate, because I was afraid she was right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I alarmed the kitten taking it out of its basket, and it bit my thumb to the bone.
It was tiny and frail but it  had teeth.
I began to have some respect for it.
That night I put it to sleep in its basket, but it climbed up on my bed and sat on my face until I let it under the covers.
There it slept perfectly still all night.
In the morning it woke me by dancing on me, chasing dust motes in a sunbeam.
It made me laugh, waking, which is a pleasant thing.
I felt that I had never laughed very much, and wanted to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he left I had to think about what he had asked me to do.
That was to go to the University as a teacher of history, and once there to volunteer for the editorship of the press.
That all seemed so preposterous, for a woman of my background and my little learning, that I thought I must be misunderstanding him.
When he convinced me that I had understood him, I thought he must have very badly misunderstood who I was and what I was capable of.
After we had talked about that for a little while, he left, evidently feeling that he was making me uncomfortable, and perhaps feeling uncomfortable himself, though in fact we laughed a good deal and I did not feel uncomfortable, only a little as if I were crazy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a phrase that&#x27;s written in a science fiction story but is most definitely Ursula&#x27;s criticism of late-stage capitalism:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cities of Corporation-owned assets who rented their own freedom&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I had to read it just to finish the arc that started in high school, but it will be my last Sanderson book.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did &lt;em&gt;Wind and truth&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; feel like such a dilemma to me?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand I found all characters to be one-dimensional, none of the plot lines were going in directions that made sense, and the style of writing was uninspired.
The worldbuilding that people hail Brandon for was severely lacking too.
No interesting new people, derivative locations; even the &quot;exploration&quot; plot line with Kaladin and Szeth was paper thin on the actual worldbuilding and interaction with the environment and its inhabitants.
The only engaging worldbuilding happened in visions from the past, about dead people (and some heralds).
This book instead spent many of its pages having characters do &quot;introspection&quot;, which was mostly very heavy-handed and literal projecting in some sort of ethically authoritative narrative voice.
To approximate moral and emotional depth, Brandon literally has characters &quot;think&quot; about how complicated their feelings are.
Every single page enforced the criticisms from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230723125646&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;brandon-sanderson-is-your-god&#x2F;&quot;&gt;2023 Wired profile&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Brandon Sanderson.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I often &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to pick up the book to continue reading.
Something kept pulling me back.
More strongly than some of the more beautiful books I&#x27;ve read.
And I ended up reading through the whole thirteen-hundred-and-twenty-nine pages in my American edition pretty quickly in just a few weeks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online reviews were pretty ruthless too.
Roughly falling into two buckets.
Either people really hated how 21st-century-Disney-woke Brandon&#x27;s writing had become (oh no, &lt;em&gt;gay&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; people having a romantic relationship).
Or they just generally had come to realize that Brandon&#x27;s writing is pretty mediocre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon Sanderson has supplanted Jonah Hill as the worst therapy guy in existence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions for book 6: Kaladin creates the DSM and establishes cognitive behavioral therapy as the Cosmere standard of care for mental health. Sanderson anachronistically uses the word ‘delulu’ in reference to Shallan. Odium realizes his problems stem from his relationship with his father and seeks to do better. Szeth’s journey of self-fulfillment continues and he and nightblood start a wellness podcast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dune Chapter 1 in the style of Brandon Sanderson:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Atreides was sweating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;time&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was it? Ah, yes, it was a week… a week before … before … what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In one week we are leaving for Arrakis&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, he thought. &lt;em&gt;They also call it Dune. But I was born on Caladan.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was hot. He held his Breath.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wasn’t there supposed to be some old woman coming to visit mother today?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was warm. He was at the Castle. Castle Caladan, it was called. It was a pile of Stone. Yet it was his home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;26 years now. No…&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; 26 generations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old woman came in. She entered Paul’s room and looked at Paul. Paul was lying in his bed. She looked at him, thinking he was sleeping. She stood before his mother, looking like a witch, her hair looking like spiderwebs. Her eyes looked like jewels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is so &lt;em&gt;small&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Jessica”, she said. “Are we &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; he is fifteen? Maybe in dog years”, the old woman mused.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is a dog?”, Jessica asked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nevermind”, the old woman said.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;show&#x2F;7063033124&quot;&gt;Olivia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (1&#x2F;5):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this was horrible, but at least I&#x27;m finally free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a beautiful long &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;show&#x2F;7075198574&quot;&gt;rant&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Стефан (3&#x2F;5).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I recognize that it might just be because of me.
Most people who&#x27;ve read the book seem to be pretty positive about it.
Maybe my tastes have just shifted away from the mass-market fantasy entertainment genre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Feels like nostalgia for a time period I just missed but that I&#x27;ve experienced second-hand by being on the internet for a while now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve never really played the computer game classics all that much in my youth.
My brother and I mostly played whatever friends played or what we could randomly get our hands on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the one piece of gaming history that I&#x27;ve grown up with is Minecraft.
A good friend introduced me to an early beta at some point, showing me his base in the side of a mountain and a wonky railway to his mines.
The years since that moment I&#x27;ve played many different versions and modpacks, and set up countless servers for playing with friends and my brother.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never considered myself a game nerd, like some friends I later met at university clearly were.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, this story does an amazing job of pulling on those threads of nostalgia, regardless of whether you lived through the specific time period yourself.
Nostalgia remains a deeply human emotion and Gabrielle knows how to wield it.
(Although Frederiek told me the book didn&#x27;t really do this for her.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s also interesting how immensely popular this book is (most popular book in NYC libraries in 2024) considering its &quot;niche&quot;.
Might be because the human story is, above all, very strong.
And it&#x27;s just fascinating to read about people that are incredibly passionate about something (making games).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A stream of consciousness that made me feel like I&#x27;m close to death myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how internal monologues work for people?
The prose is as if we&#x27;re tapping directly into a person&#x27;s thoughts.
He&#x27;s thinking the same fact or observation multiple times in a row, but slightly altered every iteration, so that it slowly builds up until he has changed his mind (or worsened the idea in his head).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is this an example of the mental fog people would experience as they get older and their body starts to give up?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not feel particularly invested in this man&#x27;s fate.
His mental clumsiness put me off from that.
But I did pity him for having to wade through his own thoughts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translated in English as &quot;A Shining&quot;.
I read the Dutch translation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/corridors-of-power/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;The most impactful TV series I&#x27;ve watched recently is &lt;em&gt;Corridors of Power: Should America Police the World?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s an insanely gripping investigation of the United States&#x27;s response (spanning four presidents) to genocides and war atrocities around the world.
From Iraq, Bosnia, and Rwanda, to Libya and Syria.
There are interviews with many of the people around the presidents at those times.
Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, policy advisors, diplomats, etc.
They all seem to talk openly about the internal debates that took place, though of course they shy away from that which they are not allowed to talk about.
But if there&#x27;s one thing to take away there, it is that there are no correct decisions to be made.
One man said it aptly:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president only has hard decisions to make, because all the easy decisions are made before they reach the president.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I long questioned whether this production is American propaganda or a genuine investigation and critique of how these administrations handled their immense power and responsibility in the face of these wars.
But I&#x27;ve made peace with my conclusion that it&#x27;s definitely both.
The narrative is centred around a certain American superiority.
Though that is also fitting for the viewpoints it investigates.
I can only assume that all of these people that intimately worked on these administrations were convinced of their own morals and convictions.
And that they were genuinenely compelled to protect civilians of countries where many other nation states had already turned a blind eye.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moments I found to be most powerful in &lt;em&gt;Corridors of Power&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are the many clips of original footage.
Most of these wars took place in a world where personal recording devices became ubiquitous.
And this series makes us watch minutes of uninterrupted video recorded by a soldier from the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska as they &quot;toy&quot; with the Bosniak men they will murder moments later, during what became the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Srebrenica_massacre&quot;&gt;Srebrenica massacre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It shows executions by IS.
It shows pictures from the aftermath of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nyarubuye_massacre&quot;&gt;Nyarubuye massacre&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Rwanda.
But not in a tasteless, sensational way (though it does make my stomach hurl from revulsion).
The series is very much aware of the emotional weight these images carry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every episode radiates a sense of powerlessness and frustration in the context of &quot;the international community&quot;.
European countries are portrayed as flaky, submissive, and without any capabilities to sustain strategic efforts for long periods of time.
Many votes for action in the United Nations get shot down by vetoes from Russia or other dissenting superpowers.
(In a cruel twist, it is now the United States that is holding back the international community by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;world&#x2F;middleeast&#x2F;gaza-ceasefire-us-veto.html&quot;&gt;vetoing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; every Gaza cease-fire resolution. Though I don&#x27;t want to pretend that I fully grasp the intricacies of this conflict.)
This all results in the inability of humanity to protect those most vulnerable and neglected.
The tragedy for some of the interviewed individuals who were personally involved in those administrations is that they were forced to watch these crises slowly unfold over years, without them able to materially impact the outcome, despite being among the handful of people who &lt;em&gt;could have&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corridors of Power&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was made by Dror Moreh, in association with the BBC.
I watched it on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npo.nl&#x2F;start&#x2F;serie&#x2F;the-corridors-of-power&quot;&gt;NPO Start&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Dutch broadcasting), but it should be available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;mediacentre&#x2F;proginfo&#x2F;2024&#x2F;32&#x2F;corridors-of-power-should-america-police-the-world&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Banks don&#x27;t reinvest savings.
They loot their para-economic privileges and enrich the wealthy few.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love any good exploration of the complex systems selling the fiction of our economy.
Aaron&#x27;s book is similarly concise as Yanis&#x27; &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;talking-to-my-daughter-about-the-economy&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Talking to my daughter about the economy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that I read earlier.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its main premise is the concept of para-economic privileges.
Purely because of their enshrined and codified position in our global financial system, commercial banks can create profits with zero marginal cost.
Contrary to the explanation that introduces most children to the concept of banks, a bank does not lend out its savers&#x27; money.
Their ability to create money (i.e., &quot;provide loans&quot;) is mostly a function of the lender&#x27;s ability to repay a loan.
And it&#x27;s arguably highly unfair that such a select group can exploit this privilege for their own gains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere midway, Aaron cites &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0025995&quot;&gt;The network of global corporate control&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Vitali et al. that uncovered a group of companies, with such high-density ownership ties that they&#x27;re practically a super-entity, which together control forty percent of the transnational capital assets.
These are precisely the &lt;em&gt;keystroke rentiers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into solving this inequality crisis, Aaron says of wealth redistribution schemes as &quot;not drilling down into the engine room of capitalism&quot; (though acknowledging that it&#x27;s of course indispensable), because they leave the engine untouched: the unlimited credit supply.
The social debate should be reframed to talk about &lt;em&gt;who&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in democratic society should decide how much money is created and who should receive it.
Aaron gives us two questions:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should banks be economized?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should money creation be democratized?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For (1), Aaron mentions sovereign money reform as a way to break the association between purchasing power and debt.
The economy relies on a constant supply of debt and thus will continue to be needed.
With sovereign money reform, there would be no more credit only loans.
Debts serve the function of distributing purchasing power.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For (2), Aaron imagines a central bank committee would decide how much purchasing power needs to be added to the economy and then parliament can spend this money.
This breaks the asset inflation loop, because governments can ensure the fresh money isn&#x27;t used in first instance to purchase assets.
And it allows the governments&#x27; budget to be funded with fresh money instead of taxes, thus lowering burdens on citizens.
But this trust in a small committee as authority is precarious.
Maybe governments should be able to fund its spending with credit it produces itself.
But there are many historical precedents of this going awry.
Then again, the risk of misuse is equally valid when private banks hold this privilege.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this book in december of 2024, but I&#x27;m writing the review in july of 2025.
If rereading parts of it made me realize anything, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;d love to read many more radical books on the economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Again an ode to the natural world, but now about oceans.
Richard&#x27;s eloquent wonder is woven through a touching stories of friendship and love (for humans &lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; nature).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went looking for this book in the bookstores in Amsterdam a few days after its release,
but the Waterstones didn&#x27;t carry it yet, and I only found it when I got to the American Book Center.
The book came along on my trip to a conference near San Diego.
And so I started reading, on the roof of a small house overlooking the sea and her surfers.
A few days later, I spent the whole afternoon reading on the beach near La Jolla Cove, precisely when the story in the book coincidentally also found its way to that exact beach, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography not too far from there.
I loved it.
Reading a book in the place where the story happens is another level of immersion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard knows what he is writing about when he writes about technology and artificial intelligence.
I think I remember reading that he used to work in Silicon Valley before he moved to the redwoods.
But Richard is also very skilled in building up human connection.
The story between Rafi Young and Todd Keane felt very real; it had the layers of complexity to justify the emotions the book wanted me to experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;overstory&quot;&gt;The Overstory&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I wrote that its natural ending was around two-thirds of the book.
But with &lt;em&gt;Playground&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the story is more confident about itself.
It still weaves many, only slightly related, plots together.
But it does it more eloquently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Like any collection of short stories; there were stronger and weaker tales.
I enjoyed everyone channeling their inner Le Guin, but some stories definitely showed
how that&#x27;s harder than it looks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an anthology of stories by about twenty-nine different authors, in tribute to Ursula K. Le Guin.
I have a weakness for anything Ursula, it seems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s go some of my notes one-by-one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-magelight&quot;&gt;I. Magelight&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-lay-of-light-and-anger&quot;&gt;A lay of light and anger&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songs, poetry, and words form the weapons in this world.
Child discovers that the rebels they always feared are actually an inspiring protest against
a dictatorial ruler they always revered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-night-bazaar-for-women-becoming-reptiles&quot;&gt;The night bazaar for women becoming reptiles&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovely title that invokes immediate inspiration.
Interestingly fresh societal norms, truly reminiscent of Le Guin; moonside and sunside partners.
A self-contained society somewhere in the desert.
And still the silent dreams of people that long to break their &lt;em&gt;mammalian husks&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wake&quot;&gt;The wake&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautiful adventure in a tangible but imaginary world.
Gods die, but humans continue their search for meaning and togetherness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;black-as-thread&quot;&gt;Black as thread&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stitching curses into fabrics as a silent resistance against military oppressors.
Jilli slowly discovers how powerful her magic truly is, with the needle feeding upon her blood.
But at the height of her power, she chooses to back off and realizes that genuinely spending time with her brother without any incantations forcing anyone to is worth way more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-woven-womb&quot;&gt;A woven womb&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weavers form children in this spiritual ritual with the two parents, tugging on threads of their souls.
But the Order forbids a weaver from bringing in themselves.
Gyndre&#x27;s most meaningful friend&#x27;s weaving threatens to go awry, producing a child immensely powerful but scared of herself.
She must break her Order&#x27;s vows to save this child&#x27;s sanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple escapes to the cold north where everyone&#x27;s still flesh-born and Gyndre stays behind to prepare the world for the return of a new most-powerful weaver.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prothalamion&quot;&gt;Prothalamion&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vogelvlucht telling of a village&#x27;s corrupted dreams that came to bear reality.
Some of these paragraphs would even work as microfiction.
All of it has a very ominous and mystical bend.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kingdom-of-the-belly&quot;&gt;The kingdom of the belly&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A girl strikes a bargain with a coyote to bring back her kitten from ghostness.
The author said she&#x27;s inspired by Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;catwing&quot; books, &quot;the royalty among children&#x27;s books.&quot;
Should give those a read then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;return-to-the-root&quot;&gt;Return to the root&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;old-souls&quot;&gt;Old souls&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s a lot of plot twists and surprises for a short story.
Even if we realize it is going to happen half a page before, that must of course have been the intention.
A clearer message than we would find in Le Guin&#x27;s work, but equally powerful.
Makes me want to finally start on some of Fonda Lee&#x27;s books.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ones-who-don-t-walk-away&quot;&gt;The ones who don&#x27;t walk away&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hauntingly dark, building on Le Guin&#x27;s Omelas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-polar-explorer&quot;&gt;The polar explorer&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best short story-to-adventure ratio&#x27;s I&#x27;ve read.
Chillingly sharp sentences on gender inequality.
Truly Le Guin-esque.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a month after she mailed her paper, &quot;On the Contours and Tendencies of Arctic Sea Ice,&quot; to the Royal Society of London, she received a rejection.
The Society&#x27;s board members believed Mínervudottír had either invented the data or stolen it from a man.
Upon reading the terse letter, she held a lit match to the healing stump of her pinky until the skin bubbled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;birds&quot;&gt;Birds&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t really know what to think.
An enjoyable little tale between two people, one homeless and living on the outside of skyscraper, with undercurrents of noticing the world around us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;homeless-gary-busey&quot;&gt;Homeless Gary Busey&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fever dream of a downward spiral.
How Ian falls back to bad Ian and becomes homeless himself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;findin-joan&quot;&gt;Findin Joan&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like one of those apocalpyse tales, but instead of making it American patriotism (which is mentioned and dismissed here), it&#x27;s about a spiritual woman of fifty-eight learning to live independent of society and men.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;becoming-human&quot;&gt;Becoming human&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No human is left alive after a nuclear disaster.
But ants take up the mantle of dangerous rhetorics and the waging of wars.
All motivated by wanting to bake cakes in the kitchen of the Jackson&#x27;s.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bee-keeper&quot;&gt;Bee, keeper&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insanely well done bee society with different factions vying for strategic interests.
There are &quot;free-hives&quot; and boxheads with discussions over the merits of symbiosis with human while they at the same time spray the air with toxins.
And then there are the religious fanatics (also boxheads) who see humans as their gods.
They recruit and send an outcast drone to assassinate the queen of queens at the congregration of queens.
Love the long names all bees carry.
Feels right.
(E.g., Yursillinianna, Rillixintraxil)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kwazulu-natal&quot;&gt;KwaZulu-natal&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving tale of a boy&#x27;s bond with an elephant he raised despite enduring an abusive father.
The boy&#x27;s father still showed some care for his son, even though he didn&#x27;t really approve of the elephant.
The end nearly brought me to tears.
The getting away from dusty Zuid-Afrika, sailing across the world, only to return to his home park and feel the rumble of Rocky.
It&#x27;s the piece of him that he&#x27;d carried with him, inside of his heart, that brought him there again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mr-uncle-s-favor&quot;&gt;Mr. Uncle&#x27;s favor&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brought tears to my eyes, in the middle of the eating hall for volunteers at ITGWO.
Such a beautiful and tender bond between a little girl and their old downstairs neighbor, who&#x27;s full of stories about Nigeria.
But the girl&#x27;s family misinterprets the stories the girl tells, thinking she&#x27;s being touched inappropriately by the old man.
They force an end to their beautiful friendship, but not really...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-time-and-darkness&quot;&gt;On time and darkness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;neuron&quot;&gt;Neuron&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A girl is a neuron, and she gets really excited about a Chloe, who is maybe a girl, and maybe a neuron.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;laddie-come-home&quot;&gt;Laddie come home&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a wearable piece of bodytech, we witness a kidnapping.
As LAD, the bodytech, learns to interpret its sensors to get a sense for the location, so are we introduced to the story.
LAD befriends the daughter of the kidnapper and manages to kick off the search and rescue.
Really cute when he follows up afterwards to make sure the girl is okay and properly looked after.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-things-were&quot;&gt;The way things were&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hardly subtle story of violent resistance against Nazi&#x2F;white-supremacy inspired by &quot;the word for world is forest&quot; but far away from its nuanced themes.
Interesting to notice that I noticed the male perspective being written as weak and hesitant, while the two girlfriends of Nick are the more violent, active types who don&#x27;t want to back down.
As in, apparently societal expectations of character stereotypes are still ingrained in my brain to a somewhat patriarchical level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;valuable&quot;&gt;Valuable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels much more like Le Guin than the last story; precise, effective, and almost carelessly pulling me in to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apocalyptic premise, with the classic &quot;the rich build a safe haven but leave the rest of the world to burn.&quot;
Glory Park is the daughter of the academics who invented time dilation.
Her mother traveled through time as a feminist vigilante.
Now Glory is stuck in the rich pod on Antarctica (her mother gave up her spot).
She travels back in time to fix mistakes and try to look for her girlfriend Frieda.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hard-choices&quot;&gt;Hard choices&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a choose-your-own-adventure story where you inadvertently get eaten by your girlfriend Bitsy, who turns out to be a carnivorous shapeshifter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-strangers-meet&quot;&gt;When strangers meet&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-human lifeforms, for which we get a brief glimpse of their society through the point-of-view of the One, who appears to rule as some sort of enlightened monarch.
The humans might be the voices from the sky?
They attempt to communicate with this society but get offered in a ritual dance to their deaths instead.
But honestly, I didn&#x27;t really know what was going on here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;joybe-s-last-dance&quot;&gt;JoyBe&#x27;s last dance&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;manionette&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; being played by thirty-six puppeteers.
A man (?) is trapped inside, but the audience loves it.
Until he (JoyBe) does things that make everyone question reality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-taster&quot;&gt;The taster&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started off flawed in ways I&#x27;ve also run into when you try to worldbuild futures where people live eternally and everything is organized &quot;fairly&quot;.
Though in this case it&#x27;s slightly dystopian.
Lots of gray, no one eats mandarins anymore except for Silvas, who gets stickered with sensors and broadcasts her sensations to millions of fully digital people.
Until many of them get killed, &quot;corrupted&quot;, by the people from the Mars colony who fight for independence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-it-die&quot;&gt;Let it die&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve praised Le Guin&#x27;s writing for being beautifully succinct while maintaining power.
This short story also has short and to-the-point sentences, but they feel blunt, exposing too much of what the writer clearly saw as the emotional beats that should make up the story.
It kind of detracts from it all.
I otherwise enjoyed the forcefully low-tech world they story built.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;each-cool-silver-orb-a-gift&quot;&gt;Each cool silver orb a gift&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do these &quot;utopia&#x27;s&quot; all feel so forced?
Most men are lost or got infertile from a chemical war, and a mysterious new gender, &lt;em&gt;the thirds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, appears.
Positions of power are only held by women, because men are too aggressive.
The revelation of a coup and the misuse of thirds for the creation of &quot;pearls&quot; that induce fertility feels implausible.
How has Helena never heard of it before until she gets on the council and goes for &lt;em&gt;one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; single walk?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wenonah-s-gift&quot;&gt;Wenonah&#x27;s gift&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story feels very Le Guin.
No rushed worldbuilding of some flimsy utopia.
Just the gentle introduction of a society and its people through the natural flow of the plot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Quirky neo-myth that keeps on tumbling before you can ask questions.
Not a children&#x27;s book, but definitely lends heavily from their type of fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;graveyard-book&quot;&gt;The Graveyard Book&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Neil some time ago, I mostly thought how much fun it&#x27;d have been if I read it when I was a child.
But &lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was just as much fun to read as an adult as I&#x27;d imagine it is as a child, if not more so!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried to explain the plot to my friends, I tumbled from one bizarity into the next, starting to realize that the plot was absolutely bonkers.
It sounds like a psychedelic dream when you explain it out loud.
But Neil does this so well!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the story I started to get slightly bored of the faery world, but Neil turns around and manages to resolve all of the threads he&#x27;s artfully started throughout the book.
Managing to keep me thoroughly engaged until the end and &lt;em&gt;past&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Steaming pile of assorted dolma, in my father&#x27;s kitchen in Tilburg, 2024.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I&#x27;d wanted to cook for some time now, when I mentioned it while writing about &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;food&#x2F;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkish cuisine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before.
It remains a struggle to confidently slot a dish like this within the arbitrary confines of a national cuisine.
But I based myself on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SwU2-5g39xk&quot;&gt;a recipe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Middle Eats that explicitly calls this variation Iraqi.
Supposedly, it is the tangy sauce made from pomegranate molasses, tamarind, and black limes that sets it apart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;My father preparing the filling, with our dolma vehicles gutted and laid out across the cutting board.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll touch on the filling and leave the vegetables and vine leaves up to your own imagination.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine minced parsley, dill, and onions in a large bowl.
Wash basmati rice until it runs clear, then add it in as well.
Add garlic, tamarind paste, pomegranate molasses, tomato paste, olive oil, sumac, salt, and baharat.
I couldn&#x27;t find any black limes on short notice in Tilburg, so instead I added some more of the tamarind paste.
Neither did I add any meat mince, since dolma works perfectly fine with a vegetarian filling.
Mix thoroughly and stuff it in your vegetables and fold it in the vine leaves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I layered potato slices at the bottom of our pot (could have cut them thicker) for a &quot;tahdig&quot;.
Start with the onions and layer the remaining vegetables on top.
Finish with the leaf rolls, because we don&#x27;t want them to be squashed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam on medium heat with a lid for fifteen minutes.
Mix the sauce (stock, pomegranate, tamarind, olive oil, tomato paste, lemon juice) and pour it in until it reaches halfway.
Boil and reduce to low.
Let it simmer while covered for forty-five minutes to an hour.
It took a bit longer before our rice was properly cooked, actually.
Optionally remove the lid and allow some of the liquid to evaporate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform a risky flip onto a platter and serve.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Heart-wrenching tale of family, spirituality, and repression.
Beautifully told in three parts of differing first-person perspectives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story centers around two sisters, Bibiana and Belonísia, on a plantation in northern Brazil.
It&#x27;s set past the abolition but amidst the cursed era of &quot;tenant farmers&quot;.
Plantation owners couldn&#x27;t keep slaves anymore, but they still &quot;needed&quot; them.
A tenant farmer is allowed to live on the land as long as they work the fields every day.
They can build houses, but only of mud, nothing too substantial.
And they may grow food in their backyards, but the owner will take a cut, since it&#x27;s growing on &quot;their&quot; land.
They don&#x27;t make any wages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the two sisters are still very young, their curiosity brings them to find a glistening knife among their grandmother&#x27;s things.
Something compels them to &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the metal and they both end up cutting their tongues.
Though one is just wounded, the other&#x27;s is &lt;em&gt;cut off&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
With one of them mute, the other becomes the voice for the both of them.
Their bond deepens and they learn to interpret each other by the most minute signs.
Except, we as the reader don&#x27;t know who is mute and who still has her voice for the entire first part of the book.
This is exceptionally well done, and truly brings a special perspective to the narrative.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our perspectives are female.
And as such, we get a taste of growing up in a male-dominated society.
Men ask for girls to come live with them in their huts.
And the girls will be expected to cook and clean and take care of the garden and birth children and raise children.
There is domestic abuse all around.
Husbands with alcohol problems who turn violent and beat their wives, their kids.
Men who rape both mother and daughter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bibiana and Belonísia&#x27;s father, Zeca Chapéu Grande, is a healer and spiritual leader for their plantation.
He hosts the festive &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jar%C3%AA&quot;&gt;Jarê&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; rituals at their home.
These religious practices have become a beautiful amalgamation of African deities and entities representing indigenous American culture.
It made me realize how, in a similar way, my mother is also a spiritual &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in her community.
She teaches meditation classes, yoga, and dabbles in naturopathy.
Friends come to her to talk about their struggles in life because she&#x27;s refreshingly good in truly hearing someone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slowly come to realize that we&#x27;re witnessing the growth of a communal culture amongst the people on the plantation.
Throughout many setbacks and injustices, I became almost defensive of the way of life and the relative peace these people enjoyed.
I became upset when they were threatened with eviction because I too felt these people had the most right of anyone to live on, but more importantly, &lt;em&gt;with&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the land.
There was so much tender care for life and a balance to their cohabitation with nature.
The way the ending creeps up, with the force of greed, authority, and capitalism, broke me a little bit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prose of this story is truly beautiful.
There&#x27;s tenderness, mystery, and meaning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father would turn to me and say, &quot;the wind doesn&#x27;t blow, the wind is the blowing,&quot;
and this made sense to me.
&quot;If the air doesn&#x27;t move, there&#x27;s no wind, and if we don&#x27;t keep moving, there&#x27;s no life.&quot;
He was trying to teach me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time after the drought ended, babies began popping up like bracket fungi on the rotting trunks of the floodplain, now transformed into marshland.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&#x27;t thank me.
He was a man, after all, why should he be grateful?
That&#x27;s what went through my mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Tobias left the house earlier than usual.
I stayed in bed.
I heard the door close behind him, then his horse trotting off into the distance.
I got up and started my day.
I watered the garden.
I cooked the breadfruit.
I delighted in the smells of my cooking.
I wondered about Maria Cabocla, present in my thoughts and prayers before I&#x27;d fallen asleep.
I prayed that she and her children were well, that she and her husband were getting along.
So that God might tame that husband of hers, I&#x27;d encourage Maria to talk to my father;
many had been cured of drunkenness by his elixirs and prayers.
There was an encantado for every problem, there was an encantado to remove that vice from her husband.
Maria seemed older than Bibiana and myself.
She wasn&#x27;t quite as old as my mother, but she&#x27;d told me that her eldest child was aged eleven.
If Maria and I stood side by side, folks would mistake her for my mother because of how worn-down she looked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered if it would have been better to have died the day I left my parents&#x27; house.
To have fallen off that horse, to have broken my neck.
Because no good ever came of my lamenting.
I knew I&#x27;d always bear the shame of having been so naive, falling for Tobias&#x27;s flattering sweet talk, no different from that of so many other cunning men who&#x27;d carry young women away from their parents&#x27; houses to turn them into slaves.
Making their lives hell, hitting them till their blood, or their very lives, poured out, leaving a trail of hatred on their bodies.
Complaining about the food, the mess, the poorly behaved children, the weather, the house falling apart.
Introducing us to the hell that so often is a woman&#x27;s life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother looked over at her granddaughter and said, &quot;I wonder who this one took after!
I&#x27;ll never forget what you girls put me through, having to rush to the hospital.&quot;
Her words upset Bibiana, but I laughed quietly, thinking to myself how a life could be repeated like an old story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the straw bag she&#x27;d woven for her son in her spare time, Donana put some jerky, a container of manioc flour, and a small bottle of honey for the journey.
Maybe, before leaving, Zeca kissed his mother&#x27;s face or Carmelita&#x27;s forehead, maybe he embraced his brothers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every heavy rain, a wall would crumble, until at last the wind finished the job.
Those walls of earth, made from the mud of the Água Negra, became earth once again.
Grasses and tiny flowers flourished in the humidity of the dew and of the rain that fell when it was the will of the saints.
I was attentive to what was happening.
I knew that none of it would come back.
I watched as though under a spell as time advanced like a horse, wild and indomitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your youngest daughter asks when her father is coming back.
You tell her he&#x27;s not coming back.
She starts crying, and yet you don&#x27;t comfort her.
If you had been the one to go, your husband wouldn&#x27;t let the children become weak.
He&#x27;d teach them to move forward by finding a purpose in their work, in the unending struggle.
Then you stroke your girl&#x27;s head, you lift her to your lap and promise her something that&#x27;s within reach,
maybe an ice cream or a bag of popcorn next time you go to town.
But you won&#x27;t tell her that he&#x27;ll come back; it would be too cruel.
Even a girl that young shouldn&#x27;t cling to a promise that can never be kept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never understood how your sister could live in that chaos of motor cars and buildings and people.
Any little thing required money there, the slightest thing.
But out in the country, the food was right within reach.
If the drought or the floods wrecked your crops, you could eat whatever was spared.
You could make food from manioc flour or gather jatoba seeds to make crêpes.
In the city there was no land to dig into, nowhere to experience that lucky omen of humid air foretelling rain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the sounds, the sounds of animals, of rustling leaves, of flowing water, those sounds kept reverberating inside of you.
During your daytime duties.
During your light sleep at night.
You felt that the sound of the world had always been your voice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even this news—that the man she held responsible for her husband&#x27;s murder was dead—brought her any peace.
The emptiness she was feeling seemed to expand with time, opening a pit inside of her that only got deeper.
The hardest truth for her to face was that nothing, not even winning the dispute for the land, would bring her husband back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zezé, Inácio, and Belonísia devoted their weekends to building the family home.
Bibiana and Salu pitched in by making lunch for everyone.
There was a sense in the air of new beginnings, like the feeling of planting in the fields after a drought or flood had come to an end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Ursula&#x27;s affinity with the Tao really shines through in this story.
When everything about the world is changing constantly, how do we practice feeling at peace with it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve finally started on some of Ursula&#x27;s most important novels that I hadn&#x27;t read yet.
Now that this one&#x27;s finished, I plan to get to &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; from the Hainish cycle soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams that change reality.
And of course George Orr (Orwell?) gets exploited for it by his psychiatrist, Haber.
Its premise is utopian, but every conscious effort to change the world takes dystopian turns.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orr&#x27;s perspective on his effective dreams is very much Taoist equanimous.
He&#x27;s pitted against the utilitarianism of Haber, culminating in the unraveling of Haber because of his exposure to the &lt;em&gt;unreality&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You speak as if that were some kind of general moral imperative.&quot;
He looked at Orr with his genial, reflective smile, stroking his beard.
&quot;But in fact, isn&#x27;t that man&#x27;s very purpose on earth—to do things, change things, run things, make a better world?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No!&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is his purpose, then?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&#x27;t know.
Things don&#x27;t have purposes, as if the universe were a machine, where every part has a useful function.
What&#x27;s the function of a galaxy?
I don&#x27;t know if our life has a purpose and I don&#x27;t see that it matters.
What does matter is that we&#x27;re a part.
Like a thread in a cloth or a grass-blade in a field.
It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
What we do is like wind blowing on the grass.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed the way Ursula made us realize how reality had changed.
The comprehensive rewriting of everyone&#x27;s memories and history isn&#x27;t something subtle—though at the same time, it is.
Because no one will &lt;em&gt;realize&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; anything changed.
Everything has always been like this, at least since last Friday.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you remember anything about April, four years ago—in &#x27;98?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;April? No, nothing special.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&#x27;s when the world ended,&quot; Orr said.
A muscular spasm disfigured his face, and he gulped as if for air.
&quot;Nobody else remembers,&quot; he said.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, never to have known a woman with brown skin, brown skin and wiry black hair cut very short so that the elegant line of the skull showed like the curve of a bronze vase—no, that was wrong.
That was intolerable.
That every soul on earth should have a body the color of a battleship: no!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s why she&#x27;s not here, he thought.
She could not have been born gray.
Her color, her color of brown, was an essential part of her, not an accident.
Her anger, timidity, brashness, gentleness, all were elements of her mixed being, her mixed nature, dark and clear right through, like Baltic amber.
She could not exist in the gray people&#x27;s world.
She had not been born.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not face his grief, his bereavement.
Dream-grief.
The loss of a woman who had never existed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He flashlighted her back to the car.
The creek shouted, the trees hung silent, the moon glowered overhead, the Aliens&#x27; moon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some poetic, Taoist-ish, stabs at meaning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there really people without resentment, without hate, she wondered.
People who never go cross-grained to the universe?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course (his thoughts proceeded, also at a walking pace), if that&#x27;s true, then the whole world as it now is should be on my side;
because I dreamed a lot of it up, too.
Well, after all, it is on my side.
That is, I&#x27;m a part of it.
Not separate from it.
I walk on the ground and the ground&#x27;s walked on by me, I breathe the air and change it, I am entirely interconnected with the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dinner George watched her; she watched him a good bit, too.
They had been married seven months.
The said nothing of any importance.
They washed up the dishes and went to bed.
In bed, they made love.
Love doesn&#x27;t just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread;
re-made all the time, made new.
When it was made, they lay in each other&#x27;s arms, holding love, asleep.
In her sleep Heather heard the roaring of a creek full of the voices of unborn children singing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not his wife, but a fiercer woman, vivid and difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; he said. &quot;Before The Break. We had... Actually, Miss Lelache, we had a date for lunch.
At Dave&#x27;s, on Ankeny.
We never made it.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#x27;m not Miss Lelache, that&#x27;s my maiden name. I&#x27;m Mrs. Andrews.&quot;
She eyed him with curiosity.
He stood and endured reality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eerlijkheid, consistentie, bereidheid tot vergeving.
Het zijn allemaal belangrijke ingrediënten van vertrouwen in een relatie, maar de belangrijkste zijn kennis en begrip.
Kennis over jezelf – je eigen zwaktes, sterke punten – en kennis over de ander.
Om die te krijgen moet je heel precies kijken en luisteren.
Niet alleen naar de ander, ook naar jezelf.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Picked it up purely because of the cover quote by The Paris Review: &lt;em&gt;The godmother of flash fiction&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Its stories dance somewhere between poetry and short fiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not quite the regular cadence of fiction.
Every sentence feels like it has a world of meaning behind it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories&#x27; themes are mostly about family, but most of all, the alienness between men and women.
What make these even more powerful is the life lived by an older woman, that seeps into the stories to make them more rounded and balanced rather than them being a breath of youthful short-sighted inclinations towards meaning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Diane truly the godmother of flash fiction?
I can at least say that her stories inspired me.
They feel like a good balance of fever dream and legibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quotes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell myself I am a prominent supporter of Ruby&#x27;s and well familiar with her tendency towards idealizing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to be unreservedly triumphant in love—that sounds good—also undefeated in
in all of the other drastically risky aspects of my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both from &lt;em&gt;Tassel rue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
The latter is a nice mocking of our expectations of perfect relationships and
our fear of being hurt or being with &quot;the wrong person&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t make friends easily with men.
I don&#x27;t really like the trouble of them.
I like the idea of men.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;One woman and five men&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sad to ask, please don&#x27;t ask—but what is the measure of this wife&#x27;s utility, character, desirability?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I ask?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Everything is wonder&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the morning, I pinned a beautiful and well-made cloth flower clip over one ear to cheer myself up,
because in my dream I had neglected a dying child while it felt like eons were passing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;I fixed my hair&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize now, after writing out some of these quotes, that their value derives much more from the context of the complete story.
The true strength of Diane&#x27;s flash fiction lies in the way her stories feverishly build up short-lived worlds.
Painting humans and their flaws and friction while the previous sentence hasn&#x27;t even ended yet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A short but powerful collage of emotions mixed up in the death of her father.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a beautifully touching portrait of Chimamanda&#x27;s Nigerian father, painted with strokes of respect, happiness, and pain.
After her father died, she did not want to move on from the grief lest its cause became too real.
Everything got more complicated by the pandemic and the Nigerian government&#x27;s fumbling.
A proper ceremony kept getting delayed while family and friends pressed the importance of following all the traditional rituals.
Through it all, Chimamanda tenderly tells us of her other family members, and we start to appreciate the way her father brought them all together.
I miss her father too now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I care as strongly about my own father?
Will I be similarly paralyzed in life when he eventually passes?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend sends me a line from my novel:
&quot;Grief was the celebration of love, those who could feel real grief were lucky to have loved.&quot;
How odd to find it so exquisitely painful to read my own words.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this quote, because I myself have also always aspired to remember this perspective whenever I felt hurt.
It being painful instead speaks to the irrationally strong intensity of emotional grief.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father&#x27;s past is familiar to me because of the stories told and retold,
and yet I always intended to document them better, to record him speaking.
I kept planning to, thinking we had time.
&quot;We will do it next time, Daddy,&quot; and he would say, &quot;Okay. Next time.&quot;
There is a sensation that is frightening, of a receding, of an ancestry slipping away,
but at least I am left with enough for myth, if not memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A beautiful collection of essays that gives an intuition for the stark contrasts in China&#x27;s society between the countryside and the metropoles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiaowei paints a compelling critique of hyper-capitalist and authoritarian trends in China.
Though frankly, it feels awfully universal.
They work in the San Francisco area and as such bring some alternative viewpoints shared amongst many young people there.
A mindset that rebels against status quo ideas of living and eagerly explores modern forms of communality.
(They describe themselves as &lt;em&gt;artist, writer, organizer and coder&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important realization that breathes throughout Xiaowei&#x27;s writing,
is that our capitalist economies can only exist because of the billions of people who were &quot;forced&quot; into unthankful labor.
People who are abstracted away for the benefit of the system.
Nothing of our globalist economy works without them.
This book explores just a few of their stories, thereby reclaiming some of their humanity.
I think it&#x27;s really important to try to grasp this humanity behind the numbers, in order to make sense of the modern world.
Only then can we as the masses hope to achieve radical reforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than seeing the way technology has shifted or produced new livelihoods in rural China,
I have been humbled to see the ways rural China fuels the technology we use every day, around the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have traded a family story, subject to the forces of political will,
for a life that changes and moves under economic forces, through the will of financial capital.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the tragedy of the commons theory is just plain wrong.
The concept was disproved with in-depth data and careful science in 1990 by Elinor Ostrom,
who would be awarded a Nobel Prize for her work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pork dishes are a large part of Han Chinese cuisine.
Pigs were domesticated in China as far back as 7000 B.C.E.,
and a 1929 anthropological survey showed that 70 percent of animal calorie intake in China was from pork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries like the United States have wheat reserves as insurance against famine, and to control food prices.
China is the only country in the world to have a pork reserve,
consisting of millions of live pigs and uncountable pounds of frozen pork.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is, she stopped feeling fulfilled when her workplace became optimized,
her work stripped of meaning, turned into mere labor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the questions we ask cannot center on the inevitability of a closed system built by AI,
and how to simply make those closed systems more rational or &quot;fair.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk by a woman balancing a bucket on her head, off to feed chickens that help control pests.
She whistles on her way up a mountain.
A whole socioeconomic ecosystem stems from the technical farming infrastructure in this village.
It makes me wonder what the parallel might be for our network infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guiyang&#x27;s status as a tech boomtown is amplified by its dreamy, sci-fi landscape.
The highway is only ten years old, but already vines and eucalyptus have crept through underpasses, covering entrance ramps.
Tunnels and bridges tumble through the city, layering cars and people on top of buildings and mountains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the military science lab was seen as the birthplace of twentieth-century nuclear annihilation,
the twenty-first century&#x27;s death by ecological destruction and unfettered capitalism is symbolized by a glass-cube conference room with a whiteboard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data gathered on me is cheap and meaningless, just as the data gathered on you is already meaningless after the moment has passed.
My last ten purchases on my credit card do not speak to the poetry of my mornings,
the slant of Californian sun at 4:00 p.m., the moment between dream and waking.
In a life with specificity and intention, the power of surveillance and data becomes deflated,
the industrial quality of rendering people into categories vanishes.
The call to an examined life begins.
There is no intrinsic value in the categorical.
There is nothing to be said about bare existence that gains power through classification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living against history can equally be applied to our understanding of data—&quot;I am not a prisoner of history.
I should not seek there for the meaning of my destiny.
I should constantly remind myself that the real leap consists in introducing invention into existence.
In the world through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food at this restaurant is humble.
The restaurant is actually the first floor of Fujiang&#x27;s home, and the kitchen is his family kitchen.
His son lights up the brick stove in the corner, coal burning underneath a large wok.
A small bowl of stir-fried tomato and egg appears, pickled radishes,
a few leaves from the season&#x27;s last cabbage, and rice from their family&#x27;s harvest.
The choices are limited by what Fujiang and his family have grown over the past year and what they&#x27;ve managed to pickle.
These tomatoes, the cabbage, and the rice are grown from heirloom seeds, preserved from previous years&#x27; crops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portions are laughably diminutive compared to the large plates of food doled out in major cities.
Yet the tomatoes are flavorful, the cabbage sweet and crisp.
&quot;This is all food we grow ourselves,&quot; Fujiang tells me.
&quot;We eat the good stuff—unlike you city people. No pesticide or fertilizer for us, too expensive to use that stuff anyway!&quot;
The dishes are heightened by fermented chili paste, which comes from the family&#x27;s chili plants.
It&#x27;s so good that I ask Fujiang if I can buy some.
He pauses, and then says it&#x27;s fine, but he has no container for me to put the paste in.
His son riffles through a cabinet and emerges with a large empty Sprite bottle.
&quot;How much is it?&quot; I ask, and it takes him a minute to think through this.
It&#x27;s clear that in this village, there are no hungry capitalists yet, no price stickers and scales.
Finally, he says, &quot;Is RMB 10 (US$1.40) a fair price? Can you pay me via WeChat?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A movement coalesced around Peppa Pig, crystallizing a careless nihilism and rejection of mainstream values.
Like in so many other countries, consumption has become the sacred value of daily life in China.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s frustrating but at the same time inspiring for its willful dismantling of the hero&#x27;s journey.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t have that much more to add, frankly.
I enjoyed the worldbuilding, the philosophizing, the dialogues that read more like something from a holy script than actual dialogues that could be had.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrating: its male-centricity.
It seems that all women&#x27;s purpose in this world is to carry children.
Except for the women that are witches (actually, even &lt;em&gt;their&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; inner life seems to revolve around childbearing).
Also typical how Paul has immense power and foresight, having been emperor for twelve years, but he still has to wonder what emotions and thoughts lie behind Chani&#x27;s blue eyes.
He remains a man.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Villeneuve&#x27;s films did a laudable job of transforming the women&#x27;s arcs into something &lt;em&gt;twenty-first century&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-ish.
Though at times it felt dangerously close to becoming a shallow love triangle at the cost of Chani and princess Irulan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a bit weird: all the powerful figures are so easily nudged to outrage.
I thought we&#x27;d established that they became powerful precisely because they were in such exact control over their emotions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s less transcendental than the first book.
But the ending still hurt me plenty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Nina Menkes&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Brainwashed: sex-camera-power&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does it all.
It serves both as a masterfully articulated indictment of the patriarchal and propagandist status quo and as an inspiring anthology of post-patriarchal cinema.
Nina incites within us a yearning for ambiguous excitement and significance far beyond the male gaze.
Here&#x27;s to the hope that we can transcend the shallow male-centricity of cinema and actually explore the richness of humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;(And more specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rDZKTrhLRdU&quot;&gt;you&#x27;re gonna carry that weight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by cormac.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
I was working on my Master’s thesis in a mostly vacated Computer Science department, because this was in the middle of the Covid pandemic.
It was a Nordic summer.
Long days of sunlight, the sweet scent of trees, and birdsongs on campus.
I often felt lonely and peaceful at the same time.
Putting in earbuds with this mix and walking through the warm corridors, or strolling between my student room and the department building.
It gave me mental clarity, or, brought me in a lucid state of mind, where I could experience the smallness of life and the immense scale of Earth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f003.backblazeb2.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;maxcrone-org&#x2F;img&#x2F;2021-05-15-otaniemi_2880.avif&quot; type=&quot;image&#x2F;avif&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Otaniemi campus, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life was focused.
Every day I would be chiseling on my academic crown jewel, even though I never felt that I truly understood the foundations on which I was building sufficiently to be worthy of laying the next brick.
In that way, I at least taught myself to be humbled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would often go to saunas with friends.
Or I would go on my own.
This delicate form of self-torture has consistently been the most meditative and calming experience for me.
I also used to meditate on the roof of a building next to mine on campus.
Every morning, climbing up there, dangling my legs over the edge, and focusing on only breathing for the next fifteen minutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visualize the beautiful and grand streets of Helsinki that I roamed with my camera in hand.
Taking in the world around me, looking for the beauty in people’s ordinary life.
At some point, I apparently decided that I’d make it a new hobby to climb on top of high buildings.
The catalyst seemed to be my realization that Finnish buildings, more often than not, have a ladder on the outside (for easy access for repairs and maintenance, I can only presume).
This is basically an invitation to climb to the roofs.
Towers on the Otaniemi campus, large apartment blocks in Helsinki, small churches, construction scaffolding.
The thrill of adrenaline is highly addictive.
And it carries a romantic, fatalistic sensation with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While living abroad, I had two relationships that petered out in their own painful ways.
This music strongly reminds me of those conflicted feelings fighting within me.
And how I had to learn to grapple with these emotions that I didn’t feel equipped to handle.
My solitudal circumstances made me live through them much more intensely and, looking back, I think I am grateful for that.
In a way it also made this period of my life more meaningful.
There is meaning in pain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember drifting around the city, along the seashores, thinking about stories.
While reading Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;snow-crash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Snow Crash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I was organizing writing competitions with friends.
&lt;em&gt;(Read &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;fiction&#x2F;vatican-psychedelic-conspiracy&#x2F;&quot;&gt;my short story&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
I sat around in nature, writing ideas, forming characters and motivations in my  mind.
Incredibly satisfying.
Almost mind-expanding.
But again, a mostly solitary experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am perhaps most grateful for the trips that we adventured on.
In both winter and summer, we traveled to places across the country.
Forests and islands.
Small cottages and tents.
(Saunas.)
The environments were something impossible, coming from The Netherlands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A tender story on grief and loss of one&#x27;s guardian.
Refreshingly honest about the unstereotypical mundanity of real life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikage has just lost her grandmother (her parents had died long before).
The grief pauses all other things in her life.
She&#x27;s &quot;adopted&quot; by Yuichi and his mother (a transwoman who used to be his father).
At theirs, Mikage learns to appreciate the little things in life again, being inspired by the pure love and carefree attitude of Eriko (the mother).
Life is good for a while and Mikage finds her way back to the kitchen, cooking ferociously for the three of them.
Some time after she&#x27;s found a new place for herself, she learns that Eriko has died (by the hand of an aggressive patron at the strip club that Eriko used to run).
Now it&#x27;s Yuichi (but also Mikage, who had come to consider Eriko as a mother of her own) who has to deal with the grief.
It drives him into a deep depression, almost pushing beyond the edge of self-harm.
Mikage navigates this tenderly, showing signs of affection and care throughout, while encouraging and giving him space to take responsibility for his own next steps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true power and strength of this story is the subtle arc from grief to gratitude for the smallest things in life, and how this can serve as a catalyst for healing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Simple and precise prose that paints one of the most human stories I&#x27;ve ever read.
The characters are so tender, even more so as we start to fathom the true reason for their existence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes me reflect on the intrinsic value of living in groups of peers (in a school), the meaning of interpersonal relationships, the many facets of friendship, and the purpose of all.
Hailsham was after all something willed into life, not because it was strictly necessary to solve a problem.
Hailsham was the pure manifestation of intrinsic value.
The life of growing up amongst peers, being guided, taught, and scolded by guardians.
Losing yourself in expressing your budding feelings and sense of self.
This is arguably no longer anything that our own schools in our own world strive for.
Though I&#x27;d like to think that it still functions similarly for many.
Probably more thanks to the intensely human instincts and motivations of our teacher, and despite our bureaucracy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending moved me strongly, because Kazuo lets us feel the journey of everything that once was and that we held dearly, as it retreats to the brittle medium of our own memories.
It pained me to read about Kathy juggling memories of Tommy, Ruth, and Hailsham in order to keep them alive and to hold on to some semblance of continuity and meaning in her own life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The donorship throughout this story also hit close to my feeling about the concept of a career in our world.
We stumble, learn, and grow, only to end up in a bureaucratic treadmill that feeds itself off of something we can give.
Though in our case, that something is less concrete, but arguably more confusingly hurtful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, something about the way this book is written.
It has tempo!
Kazuo makes sure that there&#x27;s almost no natural pause in the story.
Everything &quot;ends&quot; by alluding to how something happened, or that something was about to happen, or that everything we just read was totally changed by what someone did &lt;em&gt;next&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
And to learn what that something was, you&#x27;d only have to start on the next paragraph, or the next chapter.
Yeah, the story has amazing flow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Cute and silly adventures that have aged pretty well, to be honest.
Though there is something odd about this book.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh has a somewhat awkward sense of self-deprecation.
To a degree that feels almost insulting to the poor bear.
Many of the other characters also show depressive or fatalistic tendencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, all the logical fallacies that the forest animals spew, make the book quite endearing.
It&#x27;s rather refreshing to read something that is purposefully not optimized for believability.
Here we are, just reading about silly adventures with goofy animals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Half of the time was spent in some mildly-engaging action sequences and it made me realize that I like the Murderbot Diaries more for its worldbuilding of a weirdly hopeful dystopian spacefaring future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story picks up right after &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;fugitive-telemetry&quot;&gt;Fugitive Telemetry&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which confused me for a while, because it has been more than twenty-nine months since I&#x27;d read it.
A team from Preservation must convince a group of colonists on an alien-contaminated planet to evacuate and let them help to set up a research lab on the planet.
The problem is that an aggressive corporation called Barish-Estranza is simultaneously trying to seduce the colonists into indentured servitude in some terrible corporate mines.
Murderbot and its humans must travel into a blackout zone ravaged by storms, remnants from earlier terraforming endeavours.
They get caught up in some troublesome negotiations that naturally turn awry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t enjoy this book as much as I seemed to enjoy the earlier books.
It&#x27;s either because the action plots were truly less engaging, or because my tastes have grown to something less in-tune with this specific genre.
Either way, I still found this a satisfying little story.
And my heart is increasingly rooting for Murderbot&#x27;s careful journey of experiencing and accepting its emotions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Some thoughts after attending a workshop at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;events.ccc.de&#x2F;congress&#x2F;2023&#x2F;infos&#x2F;startpage.html&quot;&gt;CCC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about rethinking economics with David Graeber&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Debt&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as a guideline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt cancellations have been common in ancient societies.
Sumerian and Babylonian rulers regularly proclaimed debt cancellations, and their societies existed for hundreds of years.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosetta_Stone_decree&quot;&gt;Rosetta Stone&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, famous for its bilingual property that allowed historians to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs, actually decrees a debt relief for the Egyptian people.
These ancient debt cancellations mainly served to keep people out of indentured servitude to their private creditors such that they could be drafted as soldiers for the army or fulfill other public duties.
But they also functioned as a &quot;limit to the greed of private citizens&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, post-war Germany was relieved of debts in the 1953 &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;London_Agreement_on_German_External_Debts&quot;&gt;London Debt Agreement&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which significantly helped to spur Germany&#x27;s development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard people in the discussions argue that creditors would become hesitant to extend loans in an environment which regularly decrees debt reliefs.
But the historic existence of our previous examples directly contradicts this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we as citizens are taught austerity with respect to debts.
But commercial banks don&#x27;t operate on the same moral framework.
The money they lend out is not their own.
They make money by arbitraging between the central bank and us.
Their profits grow linearly with the extended amount of credit, while they outsource the monetary risks to public institutions.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it high time for another blanket debt relief?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;talking-to-my-daughter-about-the-economy&quot;&gt;Talking to my daughter about the economy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Yanis Varoufakis&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A cute little (fairy)-tale in a surprisingly fleshed out world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nghi paints a fantastical world inspired by Earth&#x27;s East Asia.
It&#x27;s mostly story-within-a-story, where the whole book spans an interview by a non-binary monk with the former handmaiden of the titular empress.
Or rather, Chi, the monk, is listening to the tales of Rabbit as they are readying to leave the palace at Lake Scarlet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novella feels like life in between stories that normally make it into books, which makes it all the more tangible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nghi&#x27;s prose is beautiful, elevating her world&#x27;s symbolism and atmosphere perfectly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt so very old.
At less than twenty-five, before everything that came after, I had no idea how long life was.
I sat with an empress on one side and a red-haired actress on the other, feeling their touch on my shoulders, my hair, and my face, their bodies close to mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Amazing and somber short stories by a unique writer.
The grit and persistence of Octavia can be felt throughout her work.
And it&#x27;s admirable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;bloodchild&quot;&gt;Bloodchild&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disturbing exploration of how male pregnancies would be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this story, the one who inseminates is a literal alien that cuts open its human and nestles its larvae inside, before sewing them back together and keeping them alive as a host for its offspring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-evening-and-the-morning-and-the-night&quot;&gt;The evening and the morning and the night&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavia plausibly shapes a world tainted by the fictional Duryea-Gode disease.
People suffering DGD gradually lose control of themselves, they &lt;em&gt;drift&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, leading to cases of self-cannibalism, neglect, and destruction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We follow Lynn, a woman with DGD, who lives together with a group of others like her.
Except, not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like her.
Both her parents had DGD, and daughters in those families leave powerful pheromones that cause out-of-control DGDs to notice and listen to them.
Lynn and her boyfriend Alan gradually start to uncover this when they visit Alan&#x27;s mother in a DGD ward that has an exceptional track record.
The woman in charge of the ward tries to recruit Lynn.
But double-DGD women have a powerful instinct to hate each other.
This makes it all the more difficult for them to coöperate on good care for regular DGDs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;near-of-kin&quot;&gt;Near of kin&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A daughter is clearing out the house of her recently deceased mother, together with her uncle.
She&#x27;d always disliked her mother, but got along very well with her uncle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sympathetic story of incest based on the bible (more like, inspired by).
It&#x27;s extremely good at engaging my attention span.
Mostly just one single conversation or dialogue, in a single setting.
This is an exceptionally good short story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;speech-sounds&quot;&gt;Speech sounds&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some riff on post-apocalyptic dystopia and zombie stories.
But instead, we are dealing with a disease that inhibits speech and writing.
It has the effect of dumbing down humans back to a level where we&#x27;ve arguably lost precisely that which makes us human.
Though the infliction comes at different levels of severity.
The story actually ends on a hopeful note.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;crossover&quot;&gt;Crossover&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menial little jobs that suck the will to live right out of you.
This short story follows Jane as she relapses; gives in to alcohol, and apparently sees ghosts of her abusive boyfriend, who should be in prison.
It has the definite autobiographical ring to it; as if writing this story was the therapy that Octavia created for herself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;positive-obsession-essay&quot;&gt;Positive obsession (essay)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afterword of this autobiographical essay, Octavia writes:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt at all that the best and the most interesting part of me is my fiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She describes how she&#x27;s been &lt;em&gt;positively obsessed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; with reading and writing since a young age.
And how many obstacles she&#x27;d to suffer through.
Near the end she tells of how rare it is for black people to be able to live from their writing work.
And she describes herself as the only black woman who writes fantasy and science fiction for a living.
This emphasizes the point of representation again, as a function of inspiration for new generations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;furor-scribendi-essay&quot;&gt;Furor scribendi (essay)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, how to live by writing for publication.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take classes and workshops&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revise until you cannot make it better&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit your work (be ready for countless rejections and don&#x27;t give up)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget about inspiration, talent, and imagination. &lt;strong&gt;Habit&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;playfulness&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;persistence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; trump all of those.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;amnesty&quot;&gt;Amnesty&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating tale, past the first contact clichés.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah had been abducted by the &quot;Communities&quot; (big, plant-based colonies of sentience) for twelve years, and now she works for them as a translator.
She helped develop a shared language based on touch; when a Community enfolds a human.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the larger part of the story, Noah primes a group of applicants for the translator job.
This makes for a brilliantly clever way to show the tension between everyone on earth, and it gives us hints about these mysterious lifeforms.
Lifeforms that surprisingly enjoy the implicatively orgasmic sensation of enfolding humans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book-of-martha&quot;&gt;The book of Martha&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new book for the bible, but thoughtfully modern and self-conscious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha (clearly Octavia herself) is summoned by God, who tasks her to change something about humanity in order to make them less self-destructive.
God seems to take great pleasure in the uncertainty this creates, while Martha struggles with the responsibility of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good, pessimistic &quot;utopia&quot; story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A tender and well-researched story, but lacking in its climactic conclusiveness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course nothing new that fiction takes an immense interest in consciousness.
But this book does a great job of exploring it in a modern fashion.
As something that you could believably read in popsci in a few years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray has still built a world with plenty of dystopian elements of late-stage capitalism.
Monolithic tech companies.
Pervasive AI applied to optimizing profits; from fishing freighters with human slave labor, to general transportation, and AIs strategizing business tactics.
An interesting exercise in short-term future telling.
Though let us hope that it won&#x27;t turn out so dystopian.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha Nguyen is a scientist studying octopi.
The octopus is the stand-in for the book&#x27;s discussions on consciousness and culture.
She gets flown to a remote island (in a hexcopter) and is stuck with an outlawed android (the first of its kind; they&#x27;re too uncannily human), and a Mongolian combat veteran turned private security (with a tank of sentient fluid in which she submerges herself to control a fleet of security drones).
Together they&#x27;re studying &quot;the monster of Con Dao&quot;; a &lt;em&gt;shapesinger&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and a whole colony of other octopi.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of deciphering their language (patterns flowing over their bodies) felt a bit underdeveloped, and pales in comparison with &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; by Ted Chiang.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that felt weirdly off, is the side-plot of Rustem (an exceptionally skilled hacker).
He was tasked by an unknown organization to break into an AI, but even only mentioning it caused his loved ones to get killed.
After having been transported to somewhere else in Istanbul, he runs into &lt;em&gt;another&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; vague organization that tries to convince him to do not any damage.
And ultimately, the only resolution we have is that a) we get told it&#x27;s Evrim (the android) whose brain he had to hack, and b) he can destroy the &quot;portal&quot; and thereby free Evrim from outside control.
Rustem&#x27;s whole arc seems to amount to a character moment for Evrim, whose internal life we have experienced way less of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the plot of Eiko and Son, who are being held captive on the automated fishing freighter for their slave labor.
Midway through the story we&#x27;re already aware of their eventual climax of having tricked the ship&#x27;s AI to steer to Con Dao, but when they eventually get there, and are obliterated by Altantsetseg&#x27;s security perimeter, nothing happens.
Son en Eiko make it to the beach, half-dead, and are picked up by the Tibetan automonks who were helping baby turtles find their way to the sea.
The story devoted a not insignificant amount of time to their struggle, but its climax feels unfinished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altantsetseg&#x27;s plot-twisting betrayal of DIANIMA by revealing her allegiance to the Tibetan Buddhist Republic has also no immediate effect, besides the implication that it&#x27;d allow Ha and Evrim to continue their research into the shapesingers for longer than when they&#x27;d have remained under DIANIMA jurisdiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed the book, but the ending felt like a bundle of loose threads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are some inexplicable pages in the history of the Ligurian coast.
Historians have been combing through primary and secondary sources for decades, but there remain a handful of mysteries.
No one can tell its present-day impact for sure.
Neither is any historian confident enough in their evidence to utter their hypotheses in anything other than their private circles.
But here are some of the facts that most experts in this strange subject matter seem to agree on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest hint comes from the height of the Republic of Genoa.
Genoves bankers were pioneering ways to leverage public debt in the Republic&#x27;s maritime ambitions.
First they had defeated Pisa, and now they were financing the Monarchy of Spain&#x27;s conquests.
Genoa&#x27;s bankers and merchants (by extension) were making sizable profits.
The first signs of its unraveling were so subtle that no one thought anything of it.
There are no documented meetings, audiences, contracts, or any other formal evidence.
Even so, debtors started defaulting, investments went awry, and the Genovese started to panic.
The blessings of hindsight uncover the Genovese unfortune as a systematic effort.
Several of Genoa&#x27;s Doges in a row started shrinking the Republic&#x27;s public debt, thereby severaly limiting the banker&#x27;s liquidity.
These state bonds had garnered so much trust that they served as collateral for lending themselves.
This had allowed the Genovese bankers to practically create money from thin air.
But the Doges stopped borrowing money and were repaying all of their maturing bonds.
The lifeblood of the financial power of Genoa dried up.
No one realized the importance of this sufficiently until it was too late.
Not much later, Genoa was incapable of defending even itself, and was conquered to be part of Napoleon&#x27;s empire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after the first world war, the German Republic and Soviet Russia were weak.
Germany was struggling under post-war reparations it owed, and Lenin had just established a communist state that desperately needed some peacetime to build itself up.
There was a large convention in Genoa with European powers.
The British prime minister was worried that punishing Germany now would destabilize Europe only further in the future.
The new French president just wished to torment their eternal enemy more.
This is where the so-called dark historians pop up again.
Just east of Genoa, in Rapallo, they brought together the German and Russian diplomats in a secret en-passant meeting.
These brokered negotiations led to an agreement of forfeiting any reparations the Germans and Soviets owed each other.
And it formed the start of a favorable diplomatic relationship between the two.
These conditions allowed both nations to focus more resources on covertly building up their military prowess.
Though relatively pacifistic and innocent on its own, historians widely understand this to have contributed to the formation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact during the second world war, which allowed Nazi Germany more breathing room to conduct their horrific plans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though both are separated by some few hundred years, the fingerprints on these events seem to point to the same force.
Purely by the deduction of elimination.
Age-old Ligurian folktales tell of a cult of creatures—half-men and half-women, but only the evil halves.
They stem from the time that ancient Phoenicians still roamed these lands.
Cursed by the Gods of all peoples, these creatures are tormented by timelessness.
They live among regular people, but keep in touch with others of their cult.
Their cruel existence, evil nature, and wisdom from thousands of years of observation and manipulation, lead these creatures to meddle in human affairs.
People like to tell how their old age has made these creatures stand outside of time and attain a more god-like lens, pushing them to wager and bet on the human course of life amongst themselves for fun, requiring a small push-or-shove here and there to make fate roll their way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historians only started turning to this tale after a peculiar find in nineteen-ninety-eight.
Authorities in Genoa had found a broken body on a stone beach with waves crashing over it.
Autopsy revealed that the corpse was years old, but its decomposition was nearly nonexistent.
They also established the nails to be at least two thousand years old.
The whole case was quickly sealed off, with individuals higher up the chains of secrecy starting a frantic investigation.
That is also how some historical experts came to be involved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to this day, no one knows how many more of these &lt;em&gt;dark historians&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; exist.
These creatures corrupted by mythology seem to have had major influences on the world, but it remains impossible to say what they are currently up to.
Human political leads have tried to uncover more in secret, but as these investigations dragged on, elected leaders changed, and still nothing came up, the political and security class forgot about it.
Silently accepting humanity&#x27;s fate as the eternal plaything of Gods and God-like creatures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-footer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this story over the course of a few days while traveling through the French and Italian Riviera by train.
I felt inspired by the natural surroundings and the area&#x27;s history and mythology.
The course of events is all purely fictional.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/books/talking-to-my-daughter-about-the-economy/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Accessible and honestly pragmatic introduction to key institutions in modern economies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is set up as a series of letters for Yanis&#x27;s teenage daughter Xenia.
Though Yanis admits several times that she realistically won&#x27;t read them all, the format works really well and elevates the fundamentally technical discussion to something more engaging.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanis begins the book by listing some of his bigger sources of inspiration, among which is &lt;em&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Jared Diamond.
Though I haven&#x27;t read it yet, I have read some of its critiques (e.g., from &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;dawn-of-everything&quot;&gt;The Dawn of Everything&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
And I saw how some paragraphs from Yanis clearly came from GGS, including parts on the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of European countries conquering native societies around the world.
Diamond writes as if European colonizers had some form of pre-determinism on their side; microbes and germs that natives were not resistant against.
This underplays the infinitely more subtle—and human—reality of history.
Europeans benefited significantly more from alliances with native groups, for example.
Ultimately, European imperialism stems more from political decisions than from pre-determinism, and its crimes are not absolved by the mere fact that Europeans &quot;had the means&quot; for global imperialism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanis&#x27;s writing also tied very nicely into my developing understanding of economies&#x27; complexities, as I&#x27;ve been reading &lt;em&gt;Democratizing Finance&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Fred Block and Robert Hockett. The latter is admittedly much more technical (though not on the level of actual scientific work in this field), but I found both to be revelatory with respect to the same subjects and ideas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanis uses the term &lt;em&gt;market society&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to mean a capitalistic society, contrasting it against &lt;em&gt;societies with markets&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which, after all, have existed for much longer.
He also distinguishes between &lt;em&gt;exchange value&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (market value) and &lt;em&gt;experimental value&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (e.g., a sunset, a joke, a dive).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market societies really began with the enclosure of the commons.
People were driven from their lands, which were divided up among a new class of landowners, who then hired back people to work on their lands.
Labour became commodified (i.e., gained exchange value).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of debt is another key point for understanding today&#x27;s economies.
It&#x27;s something I would prefer to come back to in more detail when I&#x27;m done with &lt;em&gt;Democratizing Finance&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but let me quickly sketch some thoughts on debt as I currently understand it.
Public debt is the enabler of our modern economy.
It serves as the lifeblood of commercial financial institutions (i.e., government bonds being robustly trusted).
Debts create money from thin air, and commercial banks split the inherent risk up and sell it off.
States remain with the ultimate liability, because they are basically the only non-profit actor in the system.
Debts are timetraveling devices.
Also reminds me that I should still read &lt;em&gt;Debt&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by David Graeber.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies and markets seem to be eternally trapped in irrational dilemma&#x27;s and self-fulfilling suboptima.
Again, it is only with the existence of the state as player that some of these deadlocks can be broken out of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To divert society&#x27;s course away from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-esque scenarios, Yanis argues that parts of the surplus value generated from increased automation should be public-owned (or worker-owned).
I tend to agree with this, which is basically a reformulation of collective ownership of the means of production.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also loved how Yanis gravitates towards using Greek mythology as a metaphorical device while explaining the admittedly abstract concepts in this book.
Makes me want to read Stephen Fry&#x27;s Great Mythology series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll close with some sections I highlighted from the book.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true that too much public debt can cause major headaches, too little is also a problem.
Even Singapore, whose government is forced by law not to spend more than the money it receives in taxes, finds it essential to borrow money.
Why?
Because a market society&#x27;s bankers need public debt as surely as fish need water to swim in.
Without public debt, market societies can&#x27;t work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] bankers love government bonds: not only is a bond a loan that earns a nice rate of interest very safely (so much so, in fact, that it can also be used as collateral for taking out further loans from other banks), it can also be used as a commodity—a piece of property exactly like a painting or a vintage car that can be sold immediately if the bank is in urgent need of cash.
Bonds are, in bankers&#x27; parlance, &#x27;the most liquid of assets&#x27;.
As such, they lubricate the banking system to keep its cogs and wheels turning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the economy is the engine of society and debt is its fuel, then labour is the spark, the life-breathing force that animates that engine, while money is the lubricant without which that engine would seize up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] John Maynard Keynes, wrote the following: &quot;The love of money as a possession .. will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The concluding story of Earthsea.
A culmination of Ursula&#x27;s beautiful prose and thoughtful fantasy.
We go along with events that mend the world by breaking the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it beautiful how story threads from &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;tales-from-earthsea&quot;&gt;Tales from Earthsea&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were woven together as vital pieces of &lt;em&gt;The Other Wind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
We learned of Dragonfly becoming Orm Irian, which is crucial now, when she becomes a representative for one of the branches of people in the Dragon Council.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula&#x27;s writing remains a piece of art.
She writes with tenderness.
Many of her characters transcend the adolescent tendencies of so many other fantasy works.
Her worlds and words feel mature; especially in how she deals with age.
In this book, Ged is about seventy years old, and mostly along the sidelines for the whole plot.
There&#x27;s still much wisdom in him, but his powers are spent and he remains to water the cabbages and fetch back the goats.
Tenar is greyed, tender, and wise in dealing with the sometimes youthful temper of Lebannen.
And there is room for true sorrow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending is ambiguous.
How does the breaking of the stone wall impact Earthsea?
Where exactly do dragons go when they fly on &lt;em&gt;the other wind&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?
What happens to the world after it was broken to be a whole again?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula tells us to find our own meaning in her stories.
And Earthsea lends ample opportunity for us there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see myself coming back to Earthsea to read it to my own children some time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me end this with a few passages from the book.
These aren&#x27;t the most beautiful per se, but symbolize the consistent beauty of Ursula&#x27;s prose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as he saw him old, content with his garden, with no power in him or about him but that of a soul made by a long life of thought and action, he still saw a great mage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold to the bone, he sat up, staring to see the space of the house about him, to draw its reality around him like a blanket.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the throne room with him, Lebannen said, &quot;Thank you, Sege,&quot; and the old prince said, &quot;Between you and the dragon, Lebannen, what could the poor souls say?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Five tales that explore the fascinating Earthsea world.
Loved them all for their quiet tone, beautiful prose, and inspiring voice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I rated another one of Ursula&#x27;s short story bundles called &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;orsinian-tales&quot;&gt;Orsinian tales&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with only two out of five stars.
Yet now I praise her short stories for their quietness and tender, adult emotions.
Why?
It might have to do with the fact that I can place these short stories in their context of Earthsea as I&#x27;ve experienced it through many other books already.
But I think a bigger factor is my personal maturation.
I&#x27;ve learned to feel and think about my emotions more.
This is what it must feel like to age.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-finder&quot;&gt;The finder&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the tale of Medra, and how he founded the mage school on Roke.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful prose.
Feels like reading a meditation on stillness, purpose, and intention, as if it were written down in its purest form.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear feminist lens.
Touching on the hunger for power of men.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darkrose-and-diamond&quot;&gt;Darkrose and diamond&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful and tender love story that serves as a refreshing reminder that a good life is not just about endless ambition.
Diamond gets a taste of wizardry, learns a painful lesson, and shuts his true feelings off.
Until he recognizes that he must accept himself to live happily with Darkrose as traveling musicians.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bones-of-the-earth&quot;&gt;The bones of the earth&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small story about the teach of the teacher of Ged.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wizards seem awfully inept at communication.
Why are they making themselves into hermits?
Or, why are Ursula&#x27;s wizards like this?
There must be more lively wizards in operation as well.
For now, this partly feels like a product of its time; the more formal air that authority was expected to present.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-the-high-marsh&quot;&gt;On the high marsh&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the lay of the land on Semel, and the mountain whose name is Andanden.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to touch me pretty hard in the end.
We follow Irioth, a confused but clearly very powerful wizard, while he takes up the work of healing cattle.
The villagers exploit him all, except for Gift (Emer), who is truly kind-hearted woman and widow.
At the end, Ged visits in his capacity as archmage of Roke, and tells the story that turns Irioth&#x27;s character completely upside-down.
But the way we&#x27;ve been seeing him throughout this story, gives us the character progression to make it into a fulfilling treat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dragonfly&quot;&gt;Dragonfly&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painfully stubborn patriarchy on Roke, with its nine mages and the whole student body.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the better that Irian &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, our silent, direct, and innocent daughter of a fallen lord of the island of Way, turns out to possess a power none of those mages knows.
She is a dragon.
And all of Roke is inadequately knowledgeable to teach her, so she travels instead to the land of the dragons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-description-of-earthsea&quot;&gt;A description of Earthsea&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the book contains Ursula&#x27;s attempt at consistent worldbuilding.
She goes over land, history, people, languages, and magic in Earthsea.
I remember reading that Ursula is very much a pantser.
She drew her map of the archipelago at the very start, and just went about traveling to all places along with her characters.
I find this very inspiring, and makes me want to imagine worlds as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A funny book that feels shallow on all other emotional themes at the same time.
I have the feeling that I cannot enjoy Sanderson&#x27;s books blissfully anymore ever since reading that profile in Wired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230723125646&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;brandon-sanderson-is-your-god&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Brandon Sanderson is your god (Wired)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book reads like a young-adult romance, which is already quite rare for Sanderson, as he almost never touches too deeply on the love theme in his works.
But even though the romance has a fattier thread, I found it empty and exemplary of his Christian conservatism.
It played out according to some fantastical and censored idea of love; something I also recognize from many Japanese series or stories.
Might it be explained by a cultural obsession with shyness and inexperience?
In my opinion, that&#x27;d actually mostly serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldbuilding is okay.
But I have come to slightly detest the snarky narrative voice of Hoid that we also got in Sanderson&#x27;s first secret novel.
If this is a promise for the ultimate Dragonsteel story, I&#x27;d be disappointed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed out loud in some sections, but nothing else sparked much inspiration with me.
The junk food of fantasy?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The job came with a daily dose of narcotics. Not the ones that make you feel good or have you experience a renewed wonder for life. No, these drugs forced you into a hyperfocused flow state. And it’s not about whether they were strictly needed to do the work. They were just the next epitome of increased worker productivity where the benefits only trickled upwards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two months were a blur. After a day’s work, with the effects of the drugs wearing off, Triss became so weary that she could barely make it back to the small apartment the company provided for her and find some food on its sprawling campus. Within the first week, she’d learnt to filter out the incessant hum of millions of computers churning away. And other computers zipping around to fix them. After her first month, she’d patched up and reconfigured an uncountable number of computers that maintain the worker nodes and themselves, suppossedly. An inside look made you wonder how things even kept operating, considering the enormous amount of unsustainable upkeep everything required. People like Harari used to talk about how wheat enslaved humanity during the agricultural revolution. Well, that all fell into nothing compared to the mass enslavement of humans during the AI revolution. If only humantiy had ever cared as much about educating their own children as much as they did about the eternally knowledge-hungry AI models. We as a collective might then have actually had the time and words to express some respect for our fellow humans. But the last three decades had been nothing short of a mass submission and enslavement to abstract concepts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories of the third and fourth months dissipated nearly instantaneously. For all Triss’s budding humanity at birth, she’d come to embody less consciousness than the silicon-enabled statistical models that became so effective in the illusion of thought. The company allocated its ever-growing profits without considering human values as a keystone motive. At least the early twenty-first-century fears of an exorbitantly rich upper class wielding all the political power were no longer relevant. Humanity had been freed of their class struggle after capitalist greed had outsourced the profit directive to AI and its non-human power structures. The abstract concept of increasing profits was deemed to be so important that everyone forgot the catch that it should all still benefit humanity in some way. What followed was global egalitarianism of suffering.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six months, one unparticular night, Triss returned to recharge her fleshy machine. On her bed, she found a small, plush teddybear. These type of things hadn’t been manufactured for years, so it must have been a few decades old. But the teddybear’s sheen told a different story. With her drugs subsiding, Triss felt some ancient human emotions peeking through the dense fog. A budding spark of curiosity. Her fingers grazed the soft toy’s bellly. After she turned it around, Triss noticed a small, handwritten note. It took her some time to restore her ability to decipher human writing, but the note read:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Grow the seed, then find us. Q.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triss moved to discard the note. It probably meant nothing anyway. But when she brushed the heel of her hand past the teddybear’s ticklish fur and again felt these sensory stimulations she’d never experienced before, her mind twitched a small nugget of doubt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical abberations in her brain alerted the company’s employee wellbeing daemon and a few minutes later two drug-induced security guards were knocking on the door of Triss’s sleeping cubicle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many inspiring stories and explorations of &quot;first-contact&quot; type plots, and other grand ideas.
Cixin Liu crafts these into exceptionally insightful reflections on what our human society actually entails.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wandering-earth&quot;&gt;The wandering earth&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful story about a grand idea.
Its preciseness and efficient storytelling remind me of Ted Chang.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story provides hints of what a world too focused on efficiency might lead to; a place where children are only educated in science and engineering, because those are useful when building Earth Engines and steering earth to a new solar system.
But nothing on art and philosophy.
Love is something people don&#x27;t bother with anymore.
This story also gives a soberingly realistic perspective on the sheer scale of time; &lt;em&gt;hundreds of generation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mountain&quot;&gt;Mountain&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.
This is what prototypical science fiction should be.
Stories that let you understand our scientific progress from a completely novel perspective.
Recontextualizing our understanding of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it&#x27;s a story-within-a-story about an alien civilization made up of electrically evolved lifeforms that lived in a &quot;bubble world&quot;.
Slowly, they start to discover that there&#x27;s rock around them, measuring its density and piercing together the concept of gravity.
They ultimately tunnel into the bottom of the ocean during their exploration, forcing them to learn about water (liquid) and vapor.
Made me really appreciate what our own scientists must have worked through over the course of scientific history.
Thoughtful comparisons to redshift measuring and our own expanding universe&#x2F;&lt;em&gt;bubble&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sun-of-china&quot;&gt;Sun of China&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly beautiful &quot;from scratch&quot; life path.
Gives you a hint of what it must feel like if the world and opportunities around you are rapidly changing, and you manage to sail the prosperous winds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shui Wah goes from shoe polisher to high rise window cleaner (i.e., spiderman) to &lt;em&gt;mirror farmer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on the artificial China Sun, kicking off the industrialization of space.
And ultimately he becomes the pilot of the first interstellar space ship.
He&#x27;s grown to appreciate the empty but reflective life in space and feels this duty to humanity to kick off interstellar space exploration, inspired by his mirror walk with Stephen Hawking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-the-benefit-of-mankind&quot;&gt;For the benefit of mankind&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long and personalized set up for what in the end mostly climaxes as a monologue illustrating the danger of late-stage capitalism.
But truly late-stage capitalism.
As in, a single individual owns ninety-nine percent of everything on a planet, including its atmosphere.
Makes it into a cheap villain again, but alas.
There are interesting ideas written out explicitly here.
Such as the way that barriers to education can create two substrates of the human species, that operate differently and enjoy different culture.
What if automation makes eighty-plus percent of workers truly redundant?
Will they be left to feed on the scraps?
No universal basic income?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the hitman lens and persona through which we learn about this alternate earth.
Very engagingly done.
Inspiring lesson in how I can convey large concepts at a relatable scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;curse-5-0&quot;&gt;Curse 5.0&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started off as something that I&#x27;d also been pondering on writing for some time.
A kind of humanized version of malware or cyberwarfare.
This evolution of a piece of malware called &quot;curse&quot; is pretty well done, and you can feel that Cixin appreciates and knows his basic knowledge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very self-humoring piece of writing.
Interesting exploration of the damage that a rogue AI could cause when it has full access to all internet-connected systems.
Of course it starts with medicine prescriptions and medical diagnoses as a way to wreak probabilistic havoc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-micro-era&quot;&gt;The micro-era&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we could actually solve all of our environmental problems by shrinking humanity to microscopic scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;devourer&quot;&gt;Devourer&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty good analogy for the intuitive difference between lifeforms such as humans and ants (literally).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A predatory civilization shows up with the intention to devour Earth for its resources.
Their emissary appears a century beforehand (so gentleman-like) to discuss particulars.
Earth tries to outsmart them by slinging the moon, brought out of orbit with millions of nuclear bombs, into their ship.
But the ending gives us plot twist after plot twist.
Very satisfying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;taking-care-of-god&quot;&gt;Taking care of god&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gods are literally a species who created&#x2F;started life on earth.
An advanced civilization with a different perspective on time, who seeded six different earths in case they want to come back to rest for the remainder of their civilization&#x27;s lifespan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating to think about the lifespan of civilizations.
At what stage would we be?
And how would our collapse even go?
A small nugget of long term vision on life with sufficiently advanced and intelligent technology: over the course of millennia, humans will unlearn all the skills to repair or create this technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;with-her-eyes&quot;&gt;With her eyes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful story about &quot;space travel&quot; through the earth&#x27;s mantles.
Tragic twist, when we learn that the &lt;em&gt;Sunset 6&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is forever trapped in a small cockpit in the earth&#x27;s core.
Fascinating concept where people on the earth wear glasses (&quot;eyes&quot;) that send sensory input over a high data link to the owner of those eyes, so that they can experience earth while they&#x27;re away on space missions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cannonball&quot;&gt;Cannonball&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inter-story stories: the woman trapped in earth&#x27;s core from the previous short story is the granddaughter of the protagonist in this story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the development of a tunnel through the earth to antarctica through the episodic perspective of a scientist in cryogenic sleep.
Nicely imaginative and bit on the eco-doom side of things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An amazing exercise in experiencing time and earth more like trees.
It is a beautiful critique of humanity&#x27;s collective blindness to the damage we&#x27;re bringing to the natural world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading Richard&#x27;s book The Overstory, I am captivated by the sheer scale that the perspective of trees allows us to appreciate.
The story of dynasties shapes more room for the tragedies that befall non-human webs of living humans.
I think that especially the stories of dementia and suffering parents affect me.
My dad&#x27;s slow decline of mental sharpness pains me to witness.
He must have been so much smarter than I experience him now.
And I fear that this is how I will remember him forever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading this book while on a festival in the forests in Germany.
Lying among the trees, with resin dripping down all around me, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the perfect way to read this book.
It starts out by introducing us to some eight different characters, all in the form of their own short story.
These were really well done and fit the theme of the book perfectly.
These short stories often started from a few ancestors up in the line of heritage.
They slowly described their way through life down to the actual &quot;protagonists&quot;.
This consciously long scale primes us really well to appreciate the &quot;otherwordly&quot; timeframes that trees and so much other life operates on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the book slowly weaves all of these characters together as they end up in some way or form within the ecological activist movement.
This bulk of the book felt less engaging to me.
Especially because after its perceived natural ending (setting fire to the construction pit for luxury villas, when Olivia gets killed, and everyone splits up to try to avoid the authorities), the pages dragged on for a few hundred more.
But even though we were playing in extra time, Richard treats us to moving prose and gentle descriptions of our natural co-inhabitants of this world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/notacamp/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Today (36 °C) I was at the [tbd] NOTACAMP gathering at Het Groeneveld in Amsterdam Noord.
It was less technology and more anarchy than I expected.
For the most part I hang around in the SILO, where all of the talks took place.
Topics ranged from solarpunk technology, to immunology, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delta.chat&#x2F;en&#x2F;&quot;&gt;chat over IMAP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, IPv6, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;permacomputing.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;permacomputing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and collapsology&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear theme were the ecological considerations surrounding our use of technology—now and in the future.
There is the very solarpunk-y perspective of trying to minimize your electricity consumption as much as possible because, for example, you live on a sailboat and all the electricity you use becomes very tangible once you have to haul a hundred kilograms of battery on board.
And this of course brings with it the fair point that the current pattern of energy consumption is definitely not scalable to the global human population.
Let alone the fact that worsening impact of climate change will make people want to use more air conditioning, something that slurps a ton of energy, causing the rollout of electricity lifestyles modeled after Western countries to cost disproportionately more.
It is therefore a worthy endeavour to &lt;em&gt;first&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; explore and invent all the personal solutions that make off-grid living easier, and only &lt;em&gt;then&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; start to bring about the revolution.
After all, it is disingeneous (and very hard) to get people enthusiastic for systemic change if you cannot offer them any alternatives or solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permacomputing focuses more on maximization of hardware&#x27;s lifespan and reuse of materials.
The discussion we had in the SILO started veering off into what permacomputing meant for software, and how it can be made into an analogy for the permaculture its ideas are based on.
But this very much felt like the wrong way to approach it.
Where permaculture emphasizes working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the environment and soil, because modifying and industrializing it too much will kill it in the long run, computers don&#x27;t inherently suffer when you kill a virtual machine and spawn a new one.
So to my mind, there is much merit in permacomputing, but more in the area of inspiring common knowledge on the consequences of our current levels of resource usage (among which all the metals and mineral of course, also see the Groene Amsterdammer&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.groene.nl&#x2F;lijsten&#x2F;elementen-voor-een-duurzame-toekomst&quot;&gt;series on (chemical) elements for the future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
Then there is the way we use technology ourselves.
In The Netherlands, the use of technology is hyper-individualized.
Most everyone has their own computer, laptop, or mobile phone.
All households buy their own separate internet connection from an ISP, even though there is no clear technical reason for why this needs to happen.
Uplinks are often shared between tens of households already anyway.
Hyper-individualism is mostly a marketing ploy to extract more money from citizens.
There is little to no &lt;em&gt;timesharing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; anymore.
A woman from Spain brought up that this is actually a very privileged position to be thinking from.
Many parts of the world don&#x27;t have such a high-ratioed rollout of personal technology.
And those people will share their devices and internet data bundles out of necessity.
It is again about our relationship with technology, and the realization that there exist many cultural differences in that aspect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collapsology is a new concept that we explored in a knowledge-building round-group.
There is the idea that collapses stem from built up catastrophes from varying categories; natural limits (resources), biosphere, and complexity.
Many collapses are of a negative nature, but people also told about collapses they perceived to be positive (i.e., fall of the Lehman brothers).
The session kickstarted with the statement that large change must wait for a collapse before it can take off, though the most recent &lt;em&gt;big&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; collapse of the covid pandemic delivered on none of those promises.
Many collapses might feel dreadful and negative.
A Russian woman spoke about the suffocating feeling of collapse after hearing about the invasion in Ukraine.
And the weird juxtaposition with Dutch society, where normal people were just going about their normal days, while the woman&#x27;s world was perceived to be collapsing.
The multitude and differentiality of human subcultures and lives as a basic fact of humanity&#x27;s sheer scale remains amazingly unintuitive on a personal level.
Relatedly, we established that many collapses play out on a much longer timeframe than we can intuitively understand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of seeing a crate of avocado&#x27;s in the Albert Heijn &lt;strong&gt;in winter&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve thought more often about how amazing it would be if we evolved some organs to experience time more intuitively as humans.
Alas, for now we sometimes &quot;wake up&quot; into a higher consciousness and actually experience that the collapse is all around us.
The slow collapse of global industrialization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tessel talked about three actions we can undertake in the face of a collapse:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mourning (accepting our new reality)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storytelling (creating new narratives; though also heard someone mention that there are already plenty of narratives in the world, and it&#x27;s all nice and well to do another round of intellectual stimulation, but at some point we should really get to the phase of &lt;em&gt;doing shit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niels brought up the philosophical question of whether the human condition is to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; collapsing.
Are we &lt;em&gt;collapsisms&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?
If you&#x27;d replace collapse with &lt;em&gt;change&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in all of these discussions, I&#x27;d certainly be inclined to say that this is indeed the human condition.
Without the temporal dimension there are no stories.
Stories and myths are currently the main way that our human cultures assign meaning to life.
Practicing the experience of meaning derived from pure existence alone is still a fringe hobby.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end on a practical note; one clear conclusion from this knowledge-building session was that you as an individual can start to experience meaning again after a collapse by picking a small subset and starting to work on solving it together with a community.
The direct feedback and discussions from peers bring many positive rewards in our human brain, and the collapse is no longer unfathomably large.
No need to wait with your revolution, the collapse is already here, and the best way to tackle it is to start doing stuff with friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;If only humanity had ever cared as much about educating their own children as much as they did about the eternally knowledge-hungry AI models.
We as a collective might then have actually had the time and words to express some respect for our fellow humans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I was at a summer solstice event where one woman&#x27;s performance was music made with lasers and metal sheets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&#x27;d strapped lasers to her head, so her gaze upon different sheets caused weird sounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she took a gun-contraption and put it on her chin. By pointing the laser to some metal sheet and making small sounds with her mouth, the space filled with even more otherworldly and eerie sounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A utopia is not a place where everyone&#x27;s hobby is to think and debate political organization and democracy&#x2F;anarchy.
Instead, a utopia would be a world where people enjoy each other&#x27;s company and conversation, where they enjoy nature in a sustainable and reverend manner, and where issues are peacefully resolved; bottom-up and cooperatively.
In such a utopia, life wouldn&#x27;t be a fight for the right to live.
People instead derive value from seeing each other happy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A delightful children&#x27;s book that trods along enjoyably and by the end had me more emotionally invested than I anticipated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil&#x27;s writing is deceptively simple.
I would describe it as out-of-the-way such that Neil can expertly take us along for the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would definitely read this to a child.
I think I&#x27;d have loved it when I was little.
And there remain many touching themes for adults in this book.
Even now, Bod&#x27;s nurtured excitement for all adventures he will be going on when he&#x27;s grown up resonates with me.
I imagine we will always be longing to see the world and meet her people.
It feels joyful to believe in the adventurous nature of life and I would never want to lose that out of sight.
Maybe this is why I enjoy children&#x27;s books still so much from time to time.
Are adults too disenchanted to desire these joyful adventures and dreams without reservations any longer?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Some impressions from watching NVIDIA&#x27;s GTC 2023 keynote:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA just keeps pumping out industry-specific software libraries to increase relevance (and lock-in) of its hardware&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI Computer Vision library, CV-CUDA, together with ByteDance (eighty percent of internet traffic is video content)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computational lithography&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DGX AI supercomputers (huge deal with Microsoft for H100s)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative AI is a new platform (like the internet)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA AI Foundations, an &quot;AI foundry&quot;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of targeted Accelerator configurations for different workloads (this is a business decision, because NVIDIA wouldn&#x27;t earn as much if it admitted that most organizations are also perfectly fine for their use cases without the top-of-the-line, bleeding-edge hardware)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omniverse seems mostly useful for generating synthetic data (i.e., mostly for autonomous vehicles right now)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA DGX Cloud (Azure, GCP, OCI), NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud (Azure)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Rise Bakery is a techno bakery by a tatooed and pierced baker couple.
Rise refers to both their dough&#x27;s transcendental journey and their South-American anarchistic revolutionary movement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning starts at four with stretchy folds, scorching hot ovens, and a few molotov cocktails.
Their escape from dictatorial regimes three years ago led them to a yeast festival just outside Amsterdam where folks created bacterial cultures to accomplish all sorts of things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were people who experimented with yeasts that grew an armor carapace on bonobo&#x27;s.
The next step would be to experiment on humans.
Others were growing targeted yeasts for interfacing with fungal communication networks.
The natural intelligence of trees and fungi was so foreign to most that the predatory capitalists didn&#x27;t co-opt it immediately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bakery couple found something wholly unique.
They discovered a strand of yeast that made those who consumed it more receptive to anarcho-revolutionistic ideas.
Their bakery thus became the factory of the revolution; influencing the shallow rich by way of their capitalistic group conformism.
The yeasts grew in their bodies and sprouted into class-revulsion.
No one dared to vote in conformance with megalomaniac corporations anymore.
People started to refuse lending their labor to these entities that purely produced profits for other judicial organisms.
With the corporate labor crisis looming, local cooperations thrived.
Multinationals fell apart and in their place came actually motivated humans who truly lived for each other&#x27;s mutual benefit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing from Joost de Vries in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.groene.nl&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;avant-gardisten-van-de-beschaving&quot;&gt;De Groene&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could say that the West only has a democratic tradition if we ignore the years between the time of Greek city states and the American revolution of 1776.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And isn&#x27;t it strange that we in Northwestern Europe tend to associate more with a Roman general who transcribed their military campaigns than the Germanic tribes they conquered—who were our &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ancestors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, none of the values and freedoms we like to call Western are inherently, endemically Western; every form of self-government has also appeared somewhere else in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are truly inspiring gems of microfiction in here, but reading them in book form is a shallow exercise.
They are clearly meant for microblogging platforms, where they intersperse one&#x27;s other countless number of toots and tweets as welcome nuggets of fantasy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to reproduce a few of them here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants raised in space produced nutrients that would silence the panic of being so deep in the deadly void.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rich didn&#x27;t do their own dreaming; they hired technicians to create dreams for them.
Every day teams of experts wrote flattering narrative so their corrupt employers could feel like heroes for a few hours each night.
It soothed the conscience without the need to repent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mastered antigravity, but the technology polluted our water.
Rivers soared into the sky, and oceans flowed upward into mountain ranges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moths mistake light bulbs for the extinct copper-lily, which grew by concentrating grounded lightning.
To this day, hummingbirds still run on sips of nectar taken before the last blossom shorted out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By popular vote, cold weather was cancelled.
Lavender snow fell on green fields that winter, carried by hot winds.
Our breath still hung in the air as sticky-sweet dew.
Society had little tolerance for those who longed for the vanishing cold.
Soon the old seasons were forgotten.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dan Wang writes about Yunnan cuisine in his &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danwang.co&#x2F;2022-letter&#x2F;&quot;&gt;2022 reflection letter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
When I&#x27;d write about fictional solarpunk cuisine, this is what inspires me:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can describe Yunnan cuisine only through dishes special to me.
I think of pickled bamboo shoots, gently fried, lending their funky sourness to fish soups.
I think of ham, sometimes steamed on its own, sometimes sautéd with some chili peppers, sometimes dropped in the pot to enliven a broth.
I think of whole stems of flowers, tossed with vinegar in salad.
I think of various types of rice noodles, in thick strings like Udon or as thumb-sized slices, which are more supple-bodied and offer greater chewiness than noodles made of wheat.
I think of simple farm cheeses—a rare find in Chinese culinary traditions—steamed with slices of ham.
I think of spicy pickles, indiscriminately sharpening the flavors of noodle soups or a vegetable dish, say a quick fry of lotus root.
I think of yellow strips of pea pudding, tossed in chili oil, vinegar, and some bean sprouts.
I think of a simple lunch of rice cakes fried with ham, eggs, and chives.
I think of stewed beef garnished with handfuls of fresh mint, of mashed potatoes that do not drown in butter but are suffused with salty pickles, and of simple pans of soup that have up to a half-dozen types of dark, leafy greens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Its subtitle is &quot;27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion&quot;.
And these life lessons truly are conflicting, but that makes them all the more real.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read most of this book&#x2F;pamflet on a sunny day on my balcony, whilst smelling the approach of spring fresh in the air.
It feels blissfully meditative.
It inspires me to forego limitations and doubts that only live inside my mind, and got out and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; stuff in this world.
Derek&#x27;s thoughts definitely fit into the process of enlightenment concerning the fact that it is actually really easy to completely change your life.
Going in a radically different direction is often not much more than a conscious choice you make (of course this is not as easy for a large share of the world&#x27;s population being exploited by whatever power structures hold sway over them).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of this work is also fascinatingly in line with its own messages.
You pay once for the &quot;contents&#x2F;text&quot;, and then only for all marginal production cost.
Be the change that you&#x27;d want to see in this world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I want to go about this review for its remainder, is to first list all twenty-seven chapter headings and then write down some of the paragraphs I marked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-be-independent&quot;&gt;1. Be independent&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-commit&quot;&gt;2. Commit&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So true, especially in romantic relationships.
Love is something conscious that you choose to nurture everyday anew.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time is thinly spread.
Indecision keeps you shallow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust helps your happiness more than income or health.
Trust and show you can be trusted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-fill-your-senses&quot;&gt;3. Fill your senses&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-do-nothing&quot;&gt;4. Do nothing&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your whole experience of life is in your mind.
Focus on your internal world, not external world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-think-super-long-term&quot;&gt;5. Think super-long-term&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not like the Long Now foundation, but more on the scale of your own human life and direct descendants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-intertwine-with-the-world&quot;&gt;6. Intertwine with the world&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is often historical.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(often surprisingly recent history)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, farmers in the Netherlands now are defending and nostalgic for their current way of farming (intensive, large-scale, systemic animal-torture).
But Dutch farmers ended up in this mode of production by nudges and stimulation from government and banks over the course of the last couple of decades.
If you&#x27;d ask a farmer from fifty years ago, I bet he&#x27;d find the current state of affairs appalling.
Why do farmers still defend their current way of doing business so fiercely then?
Culture seems to develop very rapidly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-make-memories&quot;&gt;7. Make memories&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-master-something&quot;&gt;8. Master something&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do anything, but not everything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I struggle with surprisingly often.
Often doubting my choices and life paths.
I wish I could live a thousand lives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting to a mountaintop after a long hike through a gorgeous forest.
Achieving your goal would feel like taking off your backpack.
That&#x27;s all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an analogy for &lt;em&gt;the journey is the destination&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-let-randomness-rule&quot;&gt;9. Let randomness rule&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-pursue-pain&quot;&gt;10. Pursue pain&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be absolutely honest with everyone.
Stop lying, completely.
You lie when you&#x27;re afraid.
You lie to avoid consequences.
Always say the truth.
Take the painful consequences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;11-do-whatever-you-want-now&quot;&gt;11. Do whatever you want now&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say everything is connected.
They&#x27;re wrong.
Everything is disconnected.
There is no line between moments in time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something happened.
Something else happened.
People love stories, so they connect two events,
calling them cause and effect.
But the connection is fiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature changes at regular intervals.
So should you.
We can&#x27;t prolong one season.
Never stay too long.
Knowing something is going to end gives you more appreciation for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;22-love&quot;&gt;22. Love&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be together by choice, not necessity or dependence.
Love you partner, but don&#x27;t need your partner.
Need is insatiable.
Need destroys love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;23-create&quot;&gt;23. Create&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay in situations where you&#x27;re forced to show your work to others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collect ideas in a crowd.
Create in silence and solitude.
Like your bedroom, your work space needs to be private.
This is where you dream and get naked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;24-don-t-die&quot;&gt;24. Don&#x27;t die&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of eating healthy is just avoiding bad food.
Most of being right is just not being wrong.
To have good people in your life, just cut out the bad ones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;25-make-a-million-mistakes&quot;&gt;25. Make a million mistakes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take on big challenges.
While everyone else is nervously preparing, you jump right in, unafraid to fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;26-make-change&quot;&gt;26. Make change&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin by righting what&#x27;s wrong.
Look for what&#x27;s ugly: ugly systems, ugly rules, ugly traditions.
Look for what bothers you.
If you can fix it, do it now.
Otherwise, aim lower until you find something you can do now.
Make it how it should be.
Don&#x27;t complain.
Just make the change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?
By using the techniques of lobbyists.
Set up a company or foundation to act through.
Make institutional change anonymously from behind the company, so your personality is not distracting the point.
Call it something generic and impossible to oppose, like &quot;Better World LLC&quot;.
Keep your public profile small.
Be humble and likable.
Prevent the straw man attack.
For each change you seek to make, find someone effective to be the face of the campaign.
Let the company and its contributors make the change.
Stay behind the scenes and quietly pull the strings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Lovely tale, where my normal critique of YA novels is internalized as Hoid&#x27;s voice.
Namely, that emotions and feelings tend to be described more directly.
Kind of like prescribing the reader how they should feel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first of Brandon&#x27;s surprise books that broke all Kickstarter records.
I purchased the set of four books too, and now I will receive a beautifully bound copy every quarter.
Though for this one I couldn&#x27;t wait until the delivery delays were resolved, and I finished the ebook before the print copy got to my door.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very enjoyable to immerse myself in Brandon&#x27;s capable worldbuilding words from time to time.
I&#x27;m past the stage where the only thing I would read is fantasy books, but when reading work like Brandon&#x27;s, it tickles my nostalgia for those adventurous stories for the mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&#x27;s kind of crazy how in-your-face the whole worldhopper narrative becomes in comparison to Brandon&#x27;s earlier books, where I would finish the whole story first and only discover the worldhoppers in it after I went to the Coppermind wiki to read some more.
This is of course at least partly explained by the fact that we&#x27;re reading it from Hoid&#x27;s perspective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m really excited for the next three stories!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Tranquility for his father’s memories.
He saw them jitter across the radio spectrum, and his tears moved in tandem.
Nothing he could do.
Not anymore.
Telco reapers continued to perform their death rite, coaxing the sap of life across their high-frequency channels.
Recognition slipped from his father’s eyes until only emptiness reflected his utter insignificance.
Nothing else left to live for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something I wrote last year.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It hits harder since what happened with my father recently.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;David Graeber &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theanarchistlibrary.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;david-graeber-fragments-of-an-anarchist-anthropology&quot;&gt;writes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of social theory would actually be of interest to those who are trying to help bring about a world in which people are free to govern their own affairs?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, I would say any such theory would have to begin with some initial assumptions.
Not many.
Probably just two.
First, it would have to proceed from the assumption that, as the Brazilian folk song puts it, &lt;strong&gt;“another world is possible.”&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
That institutions like the state, capitalism, racism and male dominance are not inevitable; that it would be possible to have a world in which these things would not exist, and that we’d all be better off as a result.
To commit oneself to such a principle is almost an act of faith, since how can one have certain knowledge of such matters?
[...]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, I’d say, is that any anarchist social theory would have to &lt;strong&gt;reject self-consciously any trace of vanguardism&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
The role of intellectuals is most definitively not to form an elite that can arrive at the correct strategic analyses and then lead the masses to follow.
But if not that, what?
This is one reason I’m calling this essay “Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology”—because this is one area where I think anthropology is particularly well positioned to help.
And not only because most actually-existing self-governing communities, and actually-existing non-market economies in the world have been investigated by anthropologists rather than sociologists or historians.
It is also because the practice of ethnography provides at least something of a model, if a very rough, incipient model, of how nonvanguardist revolutionary intellectual practice might work.

                &lt;p&gt;A space opera-esque allegory with chess-vibes.
It is interesting to finally read serious utopian worlds (i.e., The Culture).
Except that even utopian worlds are not always so utopian; where AI minds rule with calculated shrewdness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post-scarcity world, experiencing meaning seems to be a tough challenge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegory with our own predatory capitalistic world is clear when Gurgeh visits the Azad empire.
I&#x27;d say it is pretty exemplary for the whole book: the writing is clear and effective.
Others write that this book is the most minimalistic in style relative to all Ian&#x27;s books in The Culture series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many themes that are still topics of societal debates; e.g., legal rights of machines&#x2F;AIs, gender fluidity, forms of socialism, and more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Gurgeh plays any games, I get the feeling that its level of seriousness is heavily derived from chess in our real world.
At least in part of the world, Chess matches and tournaments, and chess players, enjoy a certain authority.
Gurgeh is the most honest of players; purely interested in the beauty of the game itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian expertly weaves this narrative into a world that feels so much bigger.
And I as the reader felt as if there were many plot threads and motivations that just went beyond my human comprehension; like one would in The Culture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading this book, for all its strengths.
Though I want to remark that emotional investment in characters is not one of those strengths (i.e., it is kept fairly minimal).
But that also sort of fits with the style of science fiction that Ian writes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s reflect on my calisthenics training over the past years and how I want to continue my workouts and bouldering practice going forward.
A short timeline:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reddit&#x27;s recommended routine&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bouldering&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-reddit-s-recommended-routine&quot;&gt;1. Reddit&#x27;s recommended routine&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started consciously training calisthenics after I discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;bodyweightfitness&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;kb&#x2F;recommended_routine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;recommended routine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from Reddit&#x27;s bodyweight fitness community (somewhere in 2017, I&#x27;d guess).
I kept track of my progress for the first few years using one of the Android apps made by the community.
Though I cannot seem to find my older data, here is a plot compiled from three quarters of a year during my Master&#x27;s in Finland and Sweden.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;assets&#x2F;img&#x2F;2022-10-04-workout-counts.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Monthly workout counts from June 2020 until February 2021, ranging from five to twelve, for an average of nine workouts every month, or roughly two every week.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was still the old recommended routine; it has been updated in the meantime.
The original routine consisted of three parts: warmup, skills, and strength.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warmup&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; included exercises like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic stretches
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoulder rolls&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scapular shrugs&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camel bends&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straight arm overhead pulls, chest flies, and band dislocates&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front and side leg swings&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrist mobility&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bodyline drills
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planks (including sides and reverse)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hollow hold and arch hold&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; consisted of two exercises:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handstand progression&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support progression (mostly parallel bar support)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; exercises made up the moat of this workout.
There are three groups of two different exercises, where sets are done interchangably to give time for recovery while still doing productive training.
I did three sets of every exercise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group is arguably the most intense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull up progression (worked my way up to 3 sets of 10 reps)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dips progression&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second group was often a nice break, but maybe because I never took legs as serious as upper-body.
L-sits took me a while to practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat progression&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-sit progresion (I remember the moment I made it to 60s holds; felt glorious)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third group is also pretty tough, targeting upper-body again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push up progression&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Row progression&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole routine worked pretty well for me.
I started out by doing these in my father&#x27;s house, where I could do pull ups at the stairs (by putting a field hockey stick through them) and dips using chairs and hockey sticks.
Every time I return to Tilburg, that is where I&#x27;ll do my workout again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While living in Finland, I did my workouts in UniSport Kluuvi during winter.
In Sweden I resorted to an outdoor calisthenics park on the university campus.
And back in Finland again, I started going to the athletics field on Aalto campus together with Jack.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we changed things up a bit.
Jack brought in exercises that he knew, and we tried progressions that we kind of made up ourselves.
It really taught me to have more fun in my routine (and how much fun it is to train together with someone).
There were skull crushers, different handstand progressions, push up variations, dead hang contests, floating rows, straight bar dips, weighted squats, and more.
I even started running regularly across campus, e.g., when coming from the office and running to the athletics field for our workout.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During those months, I had been practicing intermittent fasting (with the exception of the occassional citrus fruit after meditation and on my way to the office).
Meaning that I was doing most of those workouts on an empty stomach.
And only after finishing, did I go to break my fast in one of the campus restaurants together with Jack.
I remember that my energy levels actually felt very balanced.
Sure, my workouts would often feel more intensely exhausting, occassionaly to the point of almost passing out.
But the weird thing is that it made me feel &lt;em&gt;more&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in connection with my body.
I found positive satisfaction in pushing my body to its limits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-bouldering&quot;&gt;2. Bouldering&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Finnish roommate Kalle introduced me to bouldering while we lived together.
We&#x27;d bike for forty-five minutes through Finnish fields and small towns to a climbing gym.
Or we&#x27;d take a metro to the Kiipeilyareena in Kalasatama to climb with his friends.
In the end, we didn&#x27;t even end up climbing that often together, but it certainly sparked something in me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I&#x27;d moved to Amsterdam, Noemi took me bouldering at some point again.
Shortly after, she had to undergo surgery and couldn&#x27;t climb for some months, but I had tasted the exercise of the gods anew and continued.
I started meeting up with an old friend again, and together we were improving our climbing skills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels good to finally have a useful goal that motivates me to train my body.
Core strength, arm strength, and finger strength (and occassional leg work).
I was no longer training them just for the sake of training them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right about now I can climb &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grade_(bouldering)&quot;&gt;6C&#x2F;V6&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; boulders, but it took exponentially more training to get to this point.
It felt like I was plateauing, while actually I was just progressing on a logarithmic scale.
Most of the time, we go climb at Beest or Het Lab in Amsterdam.
Sometimes I go to Monk, and even more rarely I visit Block013 back in Tilburg.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the lessons I&#x27;ve learned over time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull your core&#x2F;center of gravity towards the wall&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean from straight arms to minimize exhausting them&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While leaning, make sure you position you feet and legs right&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are moves I fear I might not make, while often I can (just try, and accept death)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm up by doing easy routes very slowly (placing every limb with full intention)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to the climbing gym more often directly translates to more progress&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am going to need a whole lot more finger strength&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-future&quot;&gt;3. Future&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My training now has a few different goals:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve my climbing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve specific skills&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain general calisthenics strength&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I want to seriously improve my climbing skills.
I could quantify it (e.g., climb 10 routes of grade 7A in 2023), but I am a bit hesitant to do that.
For one because I have no clear overview of what it takes to get to a level where I can climb 7A&#x27;s.
And two, because I do not want those grade levels to become a goal in itself.
Instead, I aim to improve my general climbing skills.
As I see it, this means that I should work on a couple specific areas:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finger strength (open hand, half crimp; be careful of closed crimps, as they are disproportionately taxing) (also see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monk.nl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hangtraining-basics&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Jim Bastiaans on Monk&#x27;s blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core strength&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grip strength (sticking to big slopes, pinch)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pull strength is sufficient for now in the routes I climb.
Dedicating special effort to it would only translate to minimal results (pareto principle).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some resources to guide my training:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;9 Out of 10 Climbers Make the Same Mistakes&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Dave MacLeod&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Beastmaking&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Ned Feehally&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuff by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@hoseoklee93&quot;&gt;Hoseok Lee&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that topic, Hoseok Lee is a very impressive climber who puts out thoughtful training advice.
For example, he made a popular video on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IHHEKcfVIsg&quot;&gt;his rock climbing training routine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
In a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WMxcv6WPq18&quot;&gt;later video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; he explains that he isn&#x27;t following that exact routine anymore.
Instead, he says to just practice climbing if you want to improve your climbing.
And when you notice you&#x27;re plateauing, dedicate a few months to training (deliberate practice), and then go back to almost entirely focusing on climbing.
I think this is generally solid advice, but I want to spend some time looking at his training routine nonetheless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoseok proposes to separate climbing and training into two separate paths.
Push two training sessions to both ends of the week, and fill out the rest with two to three climbing sessions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training days have the following layout:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull-ups (10x10) (engage back muscle, let chest touch the bar)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrow&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explosive&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uneven (band) left&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uneven (band) right&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push-ups (4 sets)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offset (left, right)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit-ups (4 sets)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter kicks&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kicks&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leg raises (3 sets, 2xeach = 1 set)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same side foot (left, right)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross foot (left, right)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feet together (left, right)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campus board (once a week)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock-off touches (left, right)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid fire (up+down fast)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x2&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let me briefly touch on the specific skills I want to train.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handstand (stable, maybe progress to handstand pushups)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle up&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front lever&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planche&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing all of this training into the mix should also work plenty towards my goal of improving general calisthenics strength.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will revisit my plans and progress on two or three moments throughout the year.
For now, I should get back in the boulder hall!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As it says about itself, this book is truly written for an audience that knows little about modern science.
In that context, it does a reasonable job at invoking the wonder that science can bring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific ideas and discoveries it touches on are mostly approached via their human scientists and their stories.
It felt as if the book was dancing around the scientific subject matter itself.
It reminded me of scientists writing in newspapers, where there is little space to elaborate, and an audience too general to make meaningful assumptions on their prior knowledge.
Seeing it from that perspective, I think these seven lessons are actually very nicely constructed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder how the &lt;em&gt;seven brief lessons on computer science&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; would be written.
Could I write a riveting short text that invokes the feeling of understanding of ideas in computer science, while at the same time it remains approachable to an audience like &lt;em&gt;readers of the weekend&#x27;s supplement of a large newspaper&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
And which topics should it discuss?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas (also see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computer_science&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly touch on its inception at American research institutes, and then try to convey the amazing feat of so many computer networks around the globe being interoperable.
Give a high-level intuition on the hierarchy of autonomous systems.
Touch on the idea of &lt;em&gt;an IP packet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we include more human perspectives on this story?
Find more people who developed this and tell their stories with a slightly dramatized arc?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give an intuition for how computation using binary digits works.
Introduce the concept of the Turing machine.
Extrapolate to modern computer systems and architecture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the feeling that there are many such &lt;em&gt;weekend-newspaper-introduction&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to the concept of AI already, because of it huge scientific leaps in the last few years.
But when I tried to find some, I mostly ran into articles on &lt;em&gt;what can this specific AI do and how does it help you as an ordinary human?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a dramatized explanation would include the initial research efforts, the AI winter, and then the reinvigoration in the past decades.
It would try to give an intuition for probabilistic methods, statistical learning methods, and artificial neural networks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I had gotten the impression that many people around the internet really loved this book to the point that they put it in their top books of the year.
But honestly, I didn&#x27;t find it to live up to those expectations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for one single aspect of the book: the immensely mouthwatering descriptions of food and coffee.
The scenes where the little rat-cook bakes cinnamon buns (and his other, increasingly experimental treats) are my favorite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, it is nice for a change to read a more wholesome story in the fantasy genre.
But the book just lacks a depth of character and theme that makes it more of a Young Adult work in my opinion.
I enjoyed reading it, ultimately, but it wasn&#x27;t as inspiring or defying in novel directions for fantasy books as I&#x27;d thought.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This story made me get a feel for slavery in the antebellum South of the United States in a way that nothing else has ever done before.
It is an incredibly powerful tale, filled with expertly written tension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not presume I would ever be able to understand what it feels like to live through enslavement.
And neither does the main character, Dana, a black woman married to her white husband Kevin.
But after feeling dizzy and passing out, she finds herself transported from 1976 to 1819.
She learns that she&#x27;s called back anytime Rufus, the son of a plantation owner, is in life-threatening danger.
And slowly, she starts to piece together that Rufus is her ancestor; her great-great-grandmother would be the daughter of Rufus and a free black girl called Alice.
Dana saves the boy by instinct, and later understands that it&#x27;s crucial to protect her own ancestral line.
She&#x27;s transported back to her own time when she feels life-threatening danger herself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passes more slowly in the past.
Literally, apparently, as the passage of eight days in 1976 amounted to five years back in the nineteenth century.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana goes back and forth multiple times throughout this story.
Watching and helping Rufus grow up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all throughout, she must live on the plantation.
Though she isn&#x27;t made to work the fields, and instead learns to cook and do all other tasks around the house, we as the reader slowly follow her own enslavement.
Even Dana herself is surprised when she notices that an enslaved mindset crept up on her.
She fears it.
Where she couldn&#x27;t understand the quiet resolve of other enslaved people in the beginning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are beatings, torture.
Though it is never made to be sensational.
It is presented as how many white people from that time must have felt about it; a tool and a lawful right to manage your plantation business.
The book also manages to present the way people &lt;em&gt;think&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; about enslavement and the treatment of enslaved people in a powerfully nuanced way.
Just like Dana, we feel vile and disgusted reading how casually white people in the story dismiss black people as something inhuman.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am by far no expert on this subject matter.
The depths of feelings this story made me experience is incredibly rich.
But I cannot adequately write them into words.
I found &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kindred_(novel)#Main_themes&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&#x27;s section on the book&#x27;s main themes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; very good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the book is brilliant, in that it humanizes and grounds slaverly in the United States as something part of the direct ancestral lineage of so many people currently alive.
There are truly only just a few generations between people currently alive and those we read about and feel for in &lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Writing from Anton de Kom helped me understand the brutal violence in all its naked horror.
&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; helped me get closer to understanding the psychology of enslavement and human relations in all their imperfect shapes and forms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more thing I wanted to note about the incredible tension that Octavia is able to write into the story.
Its execution is something I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen done so well.
An aspect of it, is that she hides the tension in plain sight.
She announces something in a single sentence, such that we vaguely &lt;em&gt;know&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; what is going to happen.
Basically, that something will go wrong, sometimes writing it almost explicitly.
But only in the next paragraphs will we slowly find out &lt;em&gt;how exactly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; something will be going wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was impossible to put down this incredibly powerful story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De bende van De Korenwolf&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a classic Dutch children&#x27;s book series.
But I had never read any of the stories when I was child myself.
Noemi told me how she loved these when she was little, so I figured I&#x27;d pick up a book to read through it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series revolves around four kids who live at the hotel that their parents run.
All their adventures depart from this imagination-tickling base scenario.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book bundles three stories:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;De verwdijning van de mislukte barbie&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Het geheim van de verliefde hulpkok&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;De redding van de zwevende oma&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read them I random order, and very much enjoyed them.
Without making this into a too long-winding review, let me just note a couple of things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plots of these stories are deceptively simple from an objective point of view.
There is nothing major happening.
The beginnings quickly introduce a handful of elements (e.g., a young pop star, tabloid press, and grandmother&#x27;s declining mobility), and then Jacques weaves them all together in the rest of the story.
Such that ultimately all elements are required to resolve the plot.
Deceptively simple formula, but it sounds like a recipe for success when trying to write for children.
Especially including the many recurring motifs (&lt;em&gt;stroopwafels&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) throughtout all of the stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much for children to latch onto in recognition.
And though I cannot really tell, because I do not have children myself, I think this would bring a kid gleeful joy when reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It serves as good inspiration for my own writing, and the NaNoWriMo project I dreamt up together with Noemi (about a children&#x27;s book at De Parade, with illustrations in a similar vain to the ones appearing in De Korenwolf).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not experience the same nostalgia that I would when reading Roald Dahl or Paul Biegel or Astrid Lindgren.
But I can imagine the nostalgia I would have felt, were I to have read these books when I was young.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;His second collection of short stories is equally surgical, but more touching.
Ted has always been very strong in his imaginative science-fiction, and this bundle again contains many interesting concepts worked out in ways that truly made me ponder them in more depth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-merchant-and-the-alchemist-s-gate&quot;&gt;The merchant and the alchemist&#x27;s gate&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masterful tale of time travel, so beautiful that it almost moved me to tears.
I quivered on the inside.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories take place in an ancient Baghdad and Cairo, with sprinkles of Islam in between.
There is much wisdom in the words of its people, and very expertly woven storylines that intersect each other just right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;exhalation&quot;&gt;Exhalation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautiful ode to existence.
By investigating a source of life so different from our own, it makes me appreciate our actual life more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted seems to like to break the fourth wall; with his characters being aware of the fact that they are in writing.
Or that this is some piece of text written down by those very same characters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-expected-of-us&quot;&gt;What&#x27;s expected of us&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free will is an illusion.
Civilization now depends on self-deception, to avoid mass descend into akinetic mutism.
This is all instigated by a communication device with a negative time delay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lifecycle-of-software-objects&quot;&gt;The lifecycle of software objects&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating, in-depth case that shows us where real general artificial intelligence would come from.
Qualities such as sympathy et al. only develop over actual years of interacting with humans.
Just like baby humans develop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think there are more nuanced tones here, but generally serves as a good reminder of the sheer effort it would take to produce real general AI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dacey-s-patent-automatic-nanny&quot;&gt;Dacey&#x27;s patent automatic nanny&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fictional text accompanying a fictional museum exhibit.
Inspiring format.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touches on baby upbringing by machines instead of humans.
But the story didn&#x27;t really capture me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-truth-of-fact-the-truth-of-feeling&quot;&gt;The truth of fact, the truth of feeling&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful exploration of the value of writing, contrasted with future technologies for perfect memory that leave me with wonder for both.
And such a  powerful reminder of the fallibility of our human memory; and our tendency to form our pasts into narratives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he practiced his writing, Jijingi came to understand what Moseby had meant: writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it.
And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking.
When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements.
Writing lets you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn&#x27;t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-great-silence&quot;&gt;The great silence&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the story notes, I appreciate this piece way more.
All the small lemma&#x27;s were written for a large video art installation that juxtaposed Arecibo (&lt;em&gt;&quot;an ear capable of hearing across the universe&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) with footage of endangered Puerto Rican parrots.
A beautiful reminder that our world is already full of many forms of intelligence that we do not sufficiently appreciate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;omphalos&quot;&gt;Omphalos&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Christian view on history is omnipresent and generally accepted, proof of other planets destroys the meaning that people derived from their assumption that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; were the intention of God when he created everything.
Ends with the realization that &lt;em&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; meaning is something we derive from that which we enjoy doing, something we choose for ourselves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;anxiety-is-the-dizziness-of-freedom&quot;&gt;Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Making small choices in line with the person you want to be, makes it easier for your future self to make more of these choices&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful story touching on the concept of free choice.
Assuming parallel universes with many other versions of yourself having made different choices, what meaning does it have to make ethical choices in the current branch?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the story makes support groups (be it for alcohol, drugs, or problematic prism use) sound truly valuable.
To be able to talk through problems and be vulnerable in the presence of others, under the guidance of professionals, must be helpful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Te-Ping&#x27;s stories convey the normalcy of humanity exceptionally well, most of all.
Otherwise, they inspire little will to be exceptional, and gave me more of a creeping feeling that the individual differences between people are all relatively minute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the writing; it feels very well-crafted and thoughtful, with hints of beauty shining through everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most short story collections I read, I&#x27;ve written down my thoughts at the beginning of every chapter in the book.
I will reproduce those here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lulu&quot;&gt;Lulu&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very touching story.
It made me recall Sanderson&#x27;s writing advice that you should always tell the story from the most interesting perspective.
But this story doesn&#x27;t do that, which makes it that more distant and sad, in a good way.
The way Lulu&#x27;s brother experiences his sister is maybe more telling than a story from Lulu&#x27;s perspective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It contains elements that I somehow expect to be there, with respect to glimpses of Chinese society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents who focus on school performance&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dreary jobs and gray, soulless neighborhoods in mega-cities&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late night gaming addictions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I have these expectations?
Is it partly Western media propaganda?
Truly, yes, I guess.
Because Te-Ping works as a journalist&#x2F;correspondent in China for the Western media.
If this type of story feeds into the Western expectations of China, publishers might also be more likely to pick up the manuscript and publish the book.
Though I am sure that Te-Ping feels genuine in her experience and observations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hotline-girl&quot;&gt;Hotline girl&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dreams don&#x27;t really work out yet, but a beautify story about at least feeling reminded that you&#x27;re growing as a person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in mass-cube gray cities, one must exercise feeling content with the little things.
Are these large cities in China void of life?
I guess a big city doesn&#x27;t automatically become like New York.
But what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it take then?
For particular groups with limited means, will life always seem more &quot;boring&quot;?
When one must always keep one&#x27;s head down to grind the money for a livelihood together, is there ever space to reflect on your own wishes without feeling hopelessness?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-fruit&quot;&gt;New fruit&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice little story with an unusual point of view; the community.
&quot;We&quot; feels like the collected experience of a small neighborhood in a large city.
Almost as if we&#x27;re reconstructing a story over time from gossips and rumors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain tactical shallowness that works well in making it plausible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qiguo&#x2F;&lt;em&gt;peculiar fruit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; almost sounds like a euphemism for LSD: it can have this amazing insightful and hope-giving effect, or it can lead you to dig up trauma&#x27;s to a degree that ends up crippling you emotionally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;field-notes-on-a-marriage&quot;&gt;Field notes on a marriage&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a sad tale with no conclusive ending, but that only reminds me all the more faithfully of life&#x27;s imperfection.
Very good sketch of someone&#x27;s life, though why does it all have to be so sad?
Why do all these people sound so boring?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is life always so boring from an onlooker&#x27;s perspective?
And is it only ever worth living your own life?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s sketching a very ugly, bleak, and soulless image of China.
Is this Te-Ping&#x27;s interpretation?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;flying-machine&quot;&gt;Flying machine&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tender portrait of a simple man who has an innocent drive to prove himself and gain the respect of his neighbors in the village.
There is misplaced adoration of authority; not really competent inventions; but all of it is described as being seen as special by the villagers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being outstanding is a game of relativity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-the-street-where-you-live&quot;&gt;On the street where you live&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elegantly slow build-up to a very creepy character.
There&#x27;s little story, and all that there is feels a bit weird; just exploring someone&#x27;s life and obsession.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most short stories have been painted with broad strokes; playing out over larger periods of time.
Tends to feel slightly detached, but it is what I see the more &quot;literature&quot;-ish stories doing often.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shanghai-murmur&quot;&gt;Shanghai murmur&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a tender exploration of the normal people that make up the large bulk of our urban world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many backstories, while there&#x27;s so little room for true self expression.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of poor people having moved from countryside to big city.
The gap in education is so large.
The self-deprecating tendencies sadden me.
This weight, influence, that rich people have over the perception of others.
They dominate cultural and societal perception with their stories.
But their ambitions shouldn&#x27;t be lauded as general ambitions that the populace should strive towards.
It stems from the capitalistic pillars of most human societies now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;land-of-big-numbers&quot;&gt;Land of big numbers&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The false sense of the make-ability of monetary wealth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market truly is a weird fiction.
Poor people are seduced to believe in their chances of becoming rich themselves, while in truth there is very little probability of them moving out of their social economic status.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that this feeling was even stronger in upcoming cities in China over the past decades, because so much was changing at such a rapid pace.
Think back to what a friend said about his time in Shanghai: that he wouldn&#x27;t recognize the city after only five years away, because so much in its representation had changed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;beautiful-country&quot;&gt;Beautiful country&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tender resignation in a relationship.
Is it enough to be together with a kind-hearted person?
It feels like a very real and practical perspective on life; not encouraging others or yourself to strive to some fairytale version of reality (because chances are that you won&#x27;t ever attain such a life anyway).
But instead, having healthy acceptance towards the things you cannot change anyway.
Very Tao-like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this always makes me wonder, how do you truly know that something is outside of your capabilities?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gubeikou-spirit&quot;&gt;Gubeikou spirit&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating tale, with very clear rules in a bound-off world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuck in a train station, with no &quot;reasonable&quot; way to get out because &quot;it is policy that passengers must leave from a different station than the one they entered&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group somehow establishes a community and starts living at the train station with indefinite intentions.
There are some small revolts, but ultimately everyone resigns to their fate.
Until new trains start appearing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaginatively absurd tale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Cédric Durand writes the following in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newleftreview.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;ii136&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cedric-durand-scouting-capital-s-frontiers&quot;&gt;New Left Review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the one hand, the growing weight of financial capital retained as cash holdings suggests a lack of investment opportunities.
On the other hand, the fact that firms with top operational profit rates also hold particularly large stocks of intangibles suggests that their growth strategies increasingly rely on the acquisition of existing firms.
These developments are consistent with the diagnosis of a dysfunctional capitalism, where capital centralization takes place through processes of predation largely disconnected from productive activities—the rationale of surplus appropriation in the techno-feudal hypothesis.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from an essayistic response to earlier essays discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newleftreview.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;ii133&#x2F;articles&#x2F;evgeny-morozov-critique-of-techno-feudal-reason&quot;&gt;techno-feudalism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Evgeny Morozov) and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newleftreview.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;ii135&#x2F;articles&#x2F;timothy-erik-strom-capital-and-cybernetics&quot;&gt;cyber-capitalism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Timothy Erik Ström)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dan Luu OCR&#x27;ed texts between Elon Musk and others, originating from exhibits in the Twitter v. Musk case.
And &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;elon-twitter-texts&#x2F;&quot;&gt;published them on his website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in clear text.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These make for a fascinating insight into personal communication between high-profile business people and investors.
All of these rich people appear to be sucking up to Elon, or otherwise being very careful not to offend him in any way.
Meanwhile Elon is just talking to them all rather brusquely; makes for quite a funny read.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The plot of this second book in the series is kind of all over the place, and I did not entirely enjoy that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But shit, I was surprised by how touched I was when Jean Tannen&#x27;s newly-found romance was self-sacrificially ended.
Almost tear-worthy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott&#x27;s writing reminds me of Patrick Rothfuss&#x27;s.
Both men write very engagingly in the sentence-to-sentence, with great dialogue that entertains me throughout.
But, their plots are wandering away from a structure that would make it pleasing and fulfilling for a work of fiction.
They write as if they are just recounting some elaborate table top roleplaying game campaigns.
Sure, it might be a more &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; course of action, where one never knows which turns life will take.
And then you can end up in the most bizarre situations, even weirder than one could possibly conjure up from imagination.
But I can&#x27;t help but feel that the &quot;realistic&quot; narrative does not always work as well for emotional beats in a fictional plot.
I think this book especially would have benefited from a tighter plot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is now, I do not feel compelled to continue reading this series, and I will be moving on to other books.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of Conservatives in the USA has come to depend on the extent to which voters believe that Democrats only ever talk about diversity and gender, and never about jobs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservatives would like Forgotten America to suffer just a bit longer, precisely long enough to be able to claim that the Biden administration has done nothing for the Working Class.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ahh, I bet this will distract your mind from Delfi for a bit,” Haskel said, “you cannot be sad all the time, after all.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, you may be right, thanks Has,” Perl replied. Ever since Delfi had broken things off between them, he had become increasingly secluded. His career was meandering along, but mediocre middle-management was never a challenge anyway. His friends expected him to be heartbroken, but in truth he hadn’t felt in love anymore for months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pushed through the door and were greeted by a handsome tall server who took their coats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Welcome back, Haskel,” said the server, “this way to your table. We have a special menu tonight and I’m confident you’ll enjoy it. Right up your alley. You’ve brought a friend along, I see?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sounds great Vim, and yes, I’ve brought my friend Perl.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim turned to Perl, “A pleasure to welcome you, sir. Just to confirm, you’re one meter eighty tall and weigh seventy kilograms, correct?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh, yes, but,” stammered Perl.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing to worry about,” Haskel said, “I provided them with your information beforehand.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s to ensure that we do not overdo the portions,” said their server, while he poured Perl and Haskel some clear sparkling liquid in pitchers filled with ice. “Make yourself comfortable, and then we’ll serve you a first course soon.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl took a sip from his glass and allowed himself to relax a little. He sighed and smiled cautiously. “I’m sure she would have loved the atmosphere in this place. It buzzes with passion and creativity. She was always the more adventurous of us both.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is what we have all been worrying about,” Haskel said, “you haven’t been able to think about anything else. You’re rewriting the narrative as if you’re nothing without her, but all of us remember the passionate guy you were back in university. Where did that man go, Perl?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl hesitated. What was he doing with his life? &quot;She was perfect for me, Has. Delfi inspired me to sail again,&quot; Perl&#x27;s voice quivered, &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt as close to my parents before as when I did when we were on the seas.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that is beautiful,&quot; Haskel said, &quot;and you can still experience that connection! You can sail on your own, heck, any one of us would love to join you in your boat if you&#x27;d care to ask.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I stopped. Sailing is now doubly painful for all its memories.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on man,&quot; Haskel put his glass back on the table, rattling the three layers of cutlery, &quot;try to leave those memories behind and move on. That is what our dinner is about, after all.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A soft bell rang from the kitchen and moments later Vim appeared, weaving through tables with other guests. Most people looked to be ambiantly conversing, though some were dining alone, seemingly unbothered. When Vim reached their table, he put down two large white plates for Perl and Haskel. The outer rings of the plate guided their attention through all its empty space to the center, adorned by a dome of slightly opaque crisp.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We call this, The Heist,&quot; said Vim. He conjured two small metal hammers from his sleeve and carefully placed them alongside the plates. &quot;It&#x27;s meant to be shattered, symbolizing the start of the meal and its effects it will have on you. Underneath lie bean sprouts from the Japanese emperor&#x27;s personal garden. They glisten from a garlic confit and sparkle with salt crystals, all resting atop a cushion of baby mint leaves. Enjoy.&quot; Vim bowed politely and retreated again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, looks amazing,&quot; Perl took his small hammer and looked up at Haskel. When assured, he hit the top of the crispy dome, causing it to collapse in pieces. A small cloud of spice wafted up, hinting of savory and earthy tones. They both gathered crisps and sprouts on a spoon, smiled at each other, and then tasted their bites at the same time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its strong and fatty tastes combined with the collage of textures hit Perl powerfully, almost as if more than just food flowed through his senses. He felt his brain tingling, an explosion causing ripples through millions of neurons and synapses. It felt unlike anything he&#x27;d ever experienced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How is it?&quot; asked Haskel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no words. &quot;It&#x27;s...&quot; But there were actually no words. Perl felt a panic stirring, then finally some English came to him. &quot;It&#x27;s… powerful. Is it meant to feel so powerful?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Haskel, but his lips hinted into a smile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#x27;s as if my brain appreciates the food on a level that I&#x27;ve never felt before.&quot; Perl smiled broadly, &quot;truly fascinating, never would&#x27;ve thought this possible!&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both finished the dish in awe. Perl felt lighter. Worries far away, even though he&#x27;d felt stressed coming here.
Vim brought them more dishes. Stunning works of creativity, unique ingredients and tastes, and mind-boggling experiences. Perl started to lose track of it all as they sampled their way through the tasting menu. But the smile playing on his lips and touching his eyes never disappeared.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until something broke.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who am I?&quot; asked Perl, after he swallowed his last bite of pine-roasted celeriac glazed in flowery nectar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskel looked up at him, eyes wide. &quot;Are you joking with me? Please tell me you&#x27;re just joking.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl looked confused.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fuck, they must have gotten the dosages wrong. But they never do. It can&#x27;t be.&quot; Haskel had put down his cutlery and napkin, and was now frantically looking around. &quot;Tell me, what do you remember of Delfi?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who&#x27;s Delfi?&quot; asked Perl.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your ex-girlfriend, remember.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had a girlfriend? I must be a charming guy then. Can you tell me more about me?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskel groaned. Their server was nowhere to be seen, and all of the other guests were in their own bubble. &quot;Look, Perl, I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; Haskel said, &quot;I should have never taken you here. It was just… It seemed like the perfect solution, to forget your pain. We just wanted the Perl back that we knew.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is this… do they serve food that triggers amnesia?&quot; Perl asked, &quot;am I losing memories right now? What don&#x27;t I know? What have I forgotten?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskel became silent. He didn&#x27;t know what to do. It had gone too far.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, dessert arrived.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Very satisfying grand fantasy that has strong dialogue and plot that kept me engaged.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually started this book two years earlier, but kind of paused it after the prologue and the first chapter.
When I traveled to Italy this month, it seemed like a prime moment to pick it up again.
It had been some time since I submerged myself in a grand secondary world, especially one modeled after Italian city-states.
Traveling through Italy made the story extra immersive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that this type of epic fantasy seems to put great amounts of effort into building and conveying a world, but that the inner life and struggles of characters is slightly neglected.
In contrast, couldn&#x27;t we consider novels with more internal struggles as a &quot;tell&quot; (from the &quot;show don&#x27;t tell&quot;-rule)?
After all, there might be few ways to &quot;show&quot; what someone is thinking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book very much feels like an amazing tabletop roleplaying game, where the characters fall from one urgent matter into the next, because the dungeon master must tightly plot the engagement of their players.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe is rich and the characters are satisfyingly smart and capable.
I slightly dislike the cookie-cutter TTRPG elements of the plot, but the entertainment value ultimately makes up for it.
I&#x27;ll be reading the next book in the &lt;em&gt;Gentleman Bastard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;A plate of stacked pancakes with blueberries and bananas, with syrup drizzled over top. In Noemi&#x27;s apartment in Amsterdam, 2022&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a purely veganistic batter, with bananas squashed in for extra structure and richness.
These tasted exceptionally decadent.
See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pancake#United_States_and_Canada&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for more background.
There appear to be many varieties of pancakes around the world, of course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular variant from Northern America is a pancake made with sourdough.
&lt;em&gt;Prospectors&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; would be foraying into new terrain looking for resources, carrying sourdough with them because it could last indefinitely so long they replenished it with water and flour.
Much easier than having to find and buy yeast in areas where that wasn&#x27;t likely to be very common.
I&#x27;ve initialized a sourdough starter today (2022-08-20) that I will definitely use to create some pancakes with in the near future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Lousiana gumbo with okra, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dish is the result of a fascinating melting pot of cultures in Lousiana.
French, West-African, Spanish, and indigenous influences all find their way into gumbo.
And I am just making it for the first time, only now becoming aware of its multi-faceted history.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been craving a good okra soup, and I knew that gumbo existed, but was never really clear on what it entailed.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gumbo&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a good start, naturally.
But Adam Ragusea has also made a very insightful &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O_JVE8Hw6HY&quot;&gt;video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on this dish.
I also took inspiration from Andre Moore&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;birthedintofatherhood.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;27&#x2F;mardi-gras-chicken-sausage-gumbo-recipe&#x2F;&quot;&gt;chicken &amp;amp; sausage gumbo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (though I obviously made it without the chicken and sausage).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many variations of gumbo going around, but at least all those that I&#x27;ve seen have the Creole &lt;em&gt;holy trinity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in common.
Similar to the French &lt;em&gt;mirepoix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and the Italian &lt;em&gt;soffritto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the holy trinity is a flavor base.
It consists of celery, bell peppers, and onions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to classify the different gumbo dishes, is by the type of thickener that they use.
There exist mostly three different options: roux, okra, and filé powder.
These all stem from different cultural heritages.
Roux comes from French cuisine, okra is from West Africa, and filé powder is from indigenous Americans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a roux.
According to what I read, people from New Orleans like their roux &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; dark.
This is a dangerous game to play, as we do not want to burn the roux.
Mix equal parts oil and flour thoroughly, and then heat over medium flame while stirring constantly.
It took a solid twenty minutes of stirring before it was darkened to a caramel color, and I didn&#x27;t dare go further yet.
I put in the Creole holy trinity and sauteed everything.
Then pour in some good vegetable stock (lately I&#x27;ve taken to keeping vegetable peels in the freezer, and periodically making a large batch of bouillon from them).
Add in okra, season with thyme, bay leaves, and Cajun spices, and leave simmering.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate pan, I fried up some vegetarian sausage that I cut into slices.
Combine everything near the end, and serve over rice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One note that I want to make about this dish, is that the sliminess I expected from okra&#x27;s did not really materialize.
Is it the fact that I bought these okra&#x27;s frozen?
Or maybe their ratio in comparison with the rest of the dish was just too low.
Anyway, the gumbo was nicely thickened from the roux and the okra, without the sliminess that some people despise anyway.
Maybe it was for the better, by way of introduction for my flatmate who had never heard of okra before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A beautiful perspective on Earthsea from the unheroes, ordinary people---our people.
This book tells a wonderfully tender and loving story.
It is rich for the woman&#x27;s wisdom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula&#x27;s way of &lt;em&gt;discovering&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; her stories and characters is beautiful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But---though I knew Tenar had not stayed with Ogion but had gone off and married a farmer and lived an ordinary, unmagical life---I didn&#x27;t know why.
The story got stuck.
I couldn&#x27;t go on.
It took years of living my own ordinary life, and a great deal of learning how to think about such things, mostly from other women, before I could understand why Tenar did what she did and who she was at the end of it.
Then at last I could write &lt;em&gt;Tehanu&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I read words from Ursula, I am again astonished at how clean everything feels.
There is so much richness I can sense.
As if she has had to write her books in twice the words first, before she aggressively edits it all down to a magnificently effective flow.
As a result, her stories strike this amazing balance between the feeling of curiously wandering around and racing really fast on a straight bike lane for kilometers on end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a wealth of womanly perspective and very wise criticism of patriarchial norms that remain ever present.
Ursula lays bare how fragile men&#x27;s idea of their manliness truly is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flint had never washed a dish in his life.
Women&#x27;s work.
But Ged and Ogion had lived here, bachelors, without women; everywhere Ged had lived, it was without women; so he did the &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot; and thought nothing about it.
It would be a pity, she thought, if he did think about it, if he started fearing that his dignity hung by a dishcloth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He put his hands across his face, rubbing his temples and forehead, looking down.
&quot;I was---&quot; he said.
&quot;I&#x27;m not---&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all he could say.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped him, saying, &quot;All right, it&#x27;s all right.&quot;
She dared not touch him lest she worsen his humiliation by any semblance of pity.
She was angry at him, and for him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she talked along, woman&#x27;s babble, saving him from having to make any answer or misread any silence, until he had got over the crisis of shame, and eaten a little, and drunk a glass of the old, soft, red wine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thought about how it was to have been a woman in the prime of life, with children and a man, and then to lose all that, becoming old and a widow, powerless.
But even so she did not feel she understood his shame, his agony of humiliation.
Perhaps only a man could feel so.
A woman got used to shame.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula also beautifully touches on age and elderly in this book.
Tenar&#x27;s life and thoughts give me the most realistic impression of aging, as far as I can meaningfully judge.
Her wisdom cuts through societal norms and young people&#x27;s ambitions and willingness to play by each other&#x27;s rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so polite, she thought, all Ladies and Lords and Masters, all bows and compliments.
She glanced at the young king.
He was looking at her, smiling but reserved.
She felt as she had felt in Havnor as a girl: a barbarian, uncouth among their smoothnesses.
But because she was not a girl now, she was not awed, but only wondered at how men ordered their world into this dance of masks, and how easily a woman might learn to dance it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life danced me.
I know the dances.
But I don&#x27;t know who the dancer is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are the more realistic than life descriptions of simple living.
A life that many think they aspire to, and which is most ideally capture in Ursula&#x27;s beautiful words, but which is also clearly painted as one of hard work and sacrifices.
An example is the food.
It is always the descriptions of food that do it for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took a cake.
It was shortbread, very rich, not sweet.
The green and amber grapes were sweet and tart.
The vivid tastes of the food and wine were like the ropes that moored the ship, they moored her to the world, to her mind again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth book is the conclusion of the Earthsea books.
The fourth leg of the chair.
I&#x27;ve read this series over the course of three odd years, in which I have experienced many more things in life myself as well.
These books feel very comfortable to me.
There&#x27;s wisdom in them that I haven&#x27;t read in many other places.
There are grand adventures.
But the truly amazing thing of these books---the beautifully clear and simple ways in which they explore too real human emotions and themes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This genre-bending doorstopper is amazing.
It shifted my perspective and worldview through which I interpret and understand humanity&#x27;s past, all the way to its current and future challenges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-most-important-points-that-will-stay-with-me-forever&quot;&gt;Its most important points that will stay with me forever&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several people and reviews that have already synthesized the main points from this book that subvert the public&#x27;s idea of humanity&#x27;s history.
For reference, I think that these are the most important ones:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history of human societies is infinitely more complex than the fictionalized linear progression from hunter-gatherers, to agricultural settlements, to states.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The European age of enlightenment is not this special moment where people started thinking about organizing their societies.
The ideas are not even uniquely European.
At the time, Europe didn&#x27;t even know anything other than monarchies and the like.
Critiques from indigenous Americans on European society disseminated through missionary and travel literature exposed many of the white intellectuals to fresh ideas.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical science has this bias of only looking at periods in time that exhibit clear hierarchical structures, because from the bias of twentieth century scientists these were the signs of sophisticated civilizations.
&quot;In-between&quot; periods have been systematically under-studied, while an increasing body of research suggests that those times often show conscious social experimentation with egalitarian forms of organization and society.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is more useful to ask how we got stuck in this single idea about human society rather than asking after the &quot;origins of inequality&quot;.
This book&#x27;s main message might well be that our ancestors have always been creative in their ideas and experimentation with society, and that &lt;em&gt;we can too&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the book spells out two frameworks that are very helpful in our thinking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there are the three principles of domination.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sovereignty&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bureaucracy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charismatic politics&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there are the three basic freedoms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move away&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disobey arbitrary authority&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reimagine and reconstruct one&#x27;s society&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-the-layout-of-the-book-and-how-refreshingly-informal-i-found-it&quot;&gt;On the layout of the book and how refreshingly informal I found it&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good map to understand the book from a bird&#x27;s eye view is actually laid out by the Davids in the work itself.
Most sections carry a very descriptive subtitle that is something in between a summary and an announcement for a talk.
These individual sections almost read like independent essays.
I&#x27;ve seen them described as &lt;em&gt;overwrought Victorian section titles calligraphed in ALL CAPS.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
I posit that you&#x27;d get a good grasp of the book&#x27;s contents by just skimming over all these subtitles.
Let&#x27;s see some examples.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which we show how new discoveries concerning ancient hunter-gatherers in North America and Japan are turning social evolution on its head&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which we lay out a theory concerning the three elementary forms of domination, and begin to explore its implications for human history&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which we go in search of the real origins of bureaucracy, and find them on what appears to be a surprisingly small scale&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the Osage came to embody the principle of self-constitution, later to be celebrated in Montesquieu&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;The spirit of the laws&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-quick-overview-of-the-book-s-reception-in-other-media&quot;&gt;A quick overview of the book&#x27;s reception in other media&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of people who felt the need to write about this work, giving it a bit of a controversial aftertaste.
Though many were of course instantly triggered by the fact that David Graeber was a self-proclaimed anarchist.
A good start to research some of the book&#x27;s critiques and discussions is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Dawn_of_Everything#Reception&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
And then have a look at some of the following.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobin.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;david-graeber-the-dawn-of-everything-human-history-anthropology&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Jacobin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Ultimately, a society that accepts the story presented here as its official origin story — a story that is taught in its schools, that seeps into its public consciousness — will have to be radically different than the society we are currently living in.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;early-civilizations-had-it-all-figured-out-the-dawn-of-everything&quot;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Peter Thiel wonders why we don’t yet live in the future of our dreams. Graeber and Wengrow think the first step forward is a reminder of the past we deserve.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2021&#x2F;oct&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-dawn-of-everything-by-david-graeber-and-david-wengrow-review-inequality-is-not-the-price-of-civilisation&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Importantly, Graeber and Wengrow do not idealise a particular “golden age”; we are not being urged to embrace a Palaeolithic lifestyle. They stress the sheer variety and hybridity of early human societies – hierarchical and non-hierarchical, equal in some respects and not in others.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;graeber-wengrow-dawn-of-everything-history-humanity&#x2F;620177&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;The book is something of a glorious mess, full of fascinating digressions, open questions, and missing pieces. It aims to replace the dominant grand narrative of history not with another of its own devising, but with the outline of a picture, only just becoming visible, of a human past replete with political experiment and creativity.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the piece entered into Scott Alexander&#x27;s 2022 book review contest on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2021&#x2F;oct&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-dawn-of-everything-by-david-graeber-and-david-wengrow-review-inequality-is-not-the-price-of-civilisation&quot;&gt;Astral Codex Ten&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
I&#x27;ll look more into this later on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Debt: the first 5,000 years&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragments of an anarchist anthropology&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-of-two-main-critiques-exploring-the-book-s-applicability-to-cities-of-tens-of-millions&quot;&gt;First of two main critiques: exploring the book&#x27;s applicability to cities of tens of millions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well do the anarcho-communist ideas and direct democracy principles translate from &quot;metropolises&quot; of fifteen thousand humans to the megacities with twenty million citizens?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Davids mention that &quot;&lt;em&gt;Even the most autocratic rulers of later city-states were answerable to a panoply of town councils, neighbourhood wards and assemblies – in all of which women often participated alongside men.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&quot;
Such forms of organization can be set up in many different ways.
For example, councils can consist of rotating members sampled from a larger populace.
Or, there is a very large public assembly space for oratory direct democracy, where anyone who attends can participate.
Abstracting over these, it was often the case that a particularly sized council&#x2F;assembly represented a larger population.
Note that the roles of council members were often in the spirit of self-deprecation; a type of shame for positioning oneself in power.
This arguably makes for a more egalitarian relationship between people and their representatives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do these decentralized assemblies scale?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Teotihuacan, there were community associations known as &lt;em&gt;three-temple complexes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, at least one for every hundred apartment blocks.
An apartment block housed around one hundred people, who regularly encountered each other in a central courtyard.
Let&#x27;s assume these associations were the lowest level of bureaucratic community building that is required to smoothly operate large cities.
Then we need one community assembly for every 100 * 100 = 10,000 people.
Take my current home city of Amsterdam, with roughly 1,000,000 people living in the city proper.
Following the same logic, Amsterdam would need 100 community assemblies.
Taking it further, Mexico City has 10,000,000 citizens and would require 1,000 community assemblies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&#x27;t sound too bad, actually.
Especially when you truly internalize the sheer scale of so many people.
Such numbers of humans can undertake a breadth of activities that are hard to imagine within a single human brain.
We were not made to get a feel for these numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amsterdam.nl&#x2F;bestuur-organisatie&#x2F;zo-wordt-gemeente-bestuurd&#x2F;&quot;&gt;governed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by a directly elected municipal council, a municipal executive board, and a mayor.
The municipality is further divided into eight boroughs, which are governed by directly elected district committees.
Nothing close to those 100 &quot;community assemblies&quot;.
Possibly consequently, many people in the city don&#x27;t feel involved with the municipal politics and governance.
Would this meaningfully change with much broader and more decentralized governing?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to read the Davids discuss these questions.
For now, I must push further research into this to the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-critique-what-about-the-sapient-paradox&quot;&gt;Second critique: what about the sapient paradox?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans who wouldn&#x27;t look weird in a metro today have been around for at least 200,000 years (i.e., anatomically modern humans).
And yet, the book predominantly presents evidence for civilizations from the last 12,000 years or so, a period called the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neolithic&quot;&gt;Neolithic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;your-book-review-the-dawn-of-everything&quot;&gt;book review on Astral Codex Ten&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; comes in again.
The gap between the evolvement of modern humans and the evidence of complex societies is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sapient_paradox&quot;&gt;sapient paradox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we&#x27;re reminded.
The Davids posit that this gap at least partly originates from the historical lack of field research on the African continent.
It&#x27;s easier to dig in your metaphorical backyard.
And because scientists were predominantly white men from Western countries, that is where the research happened.
But that&#x27;s not the whole story, of course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did humanity spend those hundreds of thousands of years?
The anonymous writer asks whether there exists a hypothesis such that&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is an initial condition that keeps humanity in a Great Trap, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that said condition naturally leads to the cultural experimentation of the Neolithic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced that the second point is actually something the hypothesis needs to accommodate.
It smells like a fallacy of determinism to say that the Neolithic &lt;em&gt;must&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have happened when it happened.
Anyway, there sure must have been something going on during all those years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of the review introduces us to the &lt;em&gt;Gossip Trap&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Small groups were not organized in formally stratified structured, but are instead governed by &quot;raw social power&quot;.
Raw social power almost sounds like an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coppermind.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Investiture&quot;&gt;Investiture-based&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; magic system from Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s imagination, but the writer describes it as constant and ever-shifting reputational management.
Kind of like high school.
As an imperfect metaphor.
A lack of formal power but plenty of attention to popularity.
Gossip can act as a leveling mechanism and social power has a bunch of positives, but it&#x27;s a limiting way of organizing society.
It might have been a leveling mechanism for everyone, causing no one to have the time and mental energy to climb out to invent new stuff on much larger scales.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this sounds like exactly the third factor of domination that the Davids proposed in their work; charismatic people and heroic competition.
So even though this review reads like it is proposing a hypothesis orthogonal to everything else, it actually falls in line with the framework that the Davids laid out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference is that the anonymous writer still has no archeological evidence for any of this.
And neither had the Davids, but they did not venture into such grandiose claims of trying to spin a narrative.
It is a fascinating hypothesis, and I look forward to much further scientific research on the African content to either corroborate it or present us with new stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the annotations for now.
I might come back later to write down more thoughts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we simply guess as to what humans in other times and places might be up to, we almost invariably make guesses that are far less interesting, far les quirky – in a word, far less human than what was likely going on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-wicked-liberty&quot;&gt;2. Wicked liberty&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;persuasiveness need not take the form of logical argumentation; it can just as easily involve appeal to sentiment, whipping up passions, deploying poetic metaphors, appealing to myth or proverbial wisdom, employing irony and indirection, humour, insult, or appeals to prophecy or revelation; and the degree to which one privileges any of these has everything to do with the rhetorical tradition to which the speaker belongs, and the presumed dispositions of&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as Rousseau is careful to emphasize, the entire parable is a way to understand what made it possible for human beings to accept the notion of private property in the first place:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In translating the indigenous critique into terms that French philosophers could understand, this sense of possibility is precisely what was lost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees that equality is a value; no one seems to agree on what the term actually refers to. Equality of opportunity? Equality of condition? Formal equality before the law?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, German archaeologists, working on the plain’s northern frontier, began uncovering extremely ancient remains at a place known locally as Göbekli Tepe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans were only fully self-conscious when arguing with one another, trying to sway each other’s views, or working out a common problem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet these aristocratic courts broke apart for the summer work of the fishing season, reverting to smaller clan formations – still ranked, but with entirely different and much less formal structures. In this case, people actually adopted different names in summer and winter – literally becoming someone else, depending on the time of year.45&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seasonal dualism&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is, the actual functions of chiefly office are to (1) mediate quarrels, (2) provide for the needy, and (3) to entertain with beautiful speeches&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already quite complex, and the moment we try to define egalitarianism in positive terms everything becomes much more&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as a first approximation, we can speak of an egalitarian society if (1) most people in a given society feel they really ought to be the same in some specific way, or ways, that are agreed to be particularly important; and (2) that ideal can be said to be largely achieved in practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, only cereal-farming and grain storage made possible bureaucratic regimes like those of Pharaonic Egypt, the Maurya Empire or Han China. But to say that cereal-farming was responsible for the rise of such states is a little like saying that the development of calculus in medieval Persia is responsible for the invention of the atom bomb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 6,000 years stand between the appearance of the first farmers in the Middle East and the rise of what we are used to calling the first states; and in many parts of the world, farming never led to the emergence of anything remotely like those states.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put the matter more technically: what the Hadza, Wendat or ‘egalitarian’ people such as the Nuer seem to have been concerned with were not so much formal freedoms as substantive ones.12 They were less interested in the right to travel than in the possibility of actually doing&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the (by now irrelevant) notion that there ever was such a thing as ‘simple, ordinary foragers’,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foragers are populations which don’t rely on biologically domesticated plants and animals as their primary sources of food. Therefore, if it becomes apparent that a good number of them have in fact possessed complex systems of land tenure, or worshiped kings, or practised slavery, this altered picture of their activities doesn’t somehow magically turn them into ‘proto-farmers’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who today describe people like the Calusa as ‘atypical’ because they had such a prosperous resource base want us to believe, instead, that ancient foragers chose to avoid locations of this kind, shunning the rivers and coasts (which also offered natural arteries for movement and communication), because they were so keen to oblige later researchers by resembling twentieth-century hunter-gatherers (the sort for which detailed scientific data is available today).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-many-seasons-ago&quot;&gt;5. Many seasons ago&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systematic rejection of all domesticated foodstuffs is even more striking when one realizes that many Californians and Northwest Coast peoples did plant and grow tobacco, as well as other plants – such as springbank clover and Pacific silverweed – which they used for ritual purposes, or as luxuries consumed only at special feasts.3 In other words, they were perfectly familiar with the techniques for planting and tending to cultigens. Yet they comprehensively rejected the idea of planting everyday foodstuffs or treating crops as staples.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the very idea that the world is divided into such homogeneous units, each with its own history, is largely a product of the modern nation state, and the desire of each to claim for itself a deep territorial lineage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in neither the Northwest Coast nor the Californian culture area were there overarching political, economic or religious organizations of any kind. But within the tiny communities that did exist, entirely different principles of social life applied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this begins to make the anthropologists’ habit of lumping Yurok notables and Kwakiutl artists together as ‘affluent foragers’ or ‘complex hunter-gatherers’ seem rather silly: the equivalent of saying a Texas oil executive and a medieval Egyptian poet were both ‘complex agriculturalists’ because they ate a lot of wheat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the matter more technically, we might ask what ultimately determines the shape a society takes: economic factors, organizational imperatives or cultural meanings and ideas?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;social death&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly an elegant theory, quite clever and satisfying in its own way.54 The problem is it just doesn’t seem to match up to historical reality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental determinists have an unfortunate tendency to treat humans as little more than automata, living out some economist’s fantasy of rational calculation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems part of the human condition that while we cannot predict future events, as soon as those events do happen we find it hard to see them as anything but inevitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slavery, we’ve argued, became commonplace on the Northwest Coast largely because an ambitious aristocracy found itself unable to reduce its free subjects to a dependable workforce.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, most archaeologists consider it deeply unsound to interpret prehistoric images of corpulent women as ‘fertility goddesses’. The very idea that they should be is the result of long-outmoded Victorian fantasies about ‘primitive matriarchy’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something ineluctable about all this. But only if we accept the premise that it does in fact make sense to look at the whole process ‘from the viewpoint of wheat’. On reflection, why should we?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s the key point: if crops, rather than humans, had been setting the pace, these two processes would have gone hand in hand, leading to the domestication of large-seeded grasses within a few decades.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of fixed fields, they exploited alluvial soils on the margins of lakes and springs, which shifted location from year to year. Instead of hewing wood, tilling fields and carrying water, they found ways of ‘persuading’ nature to do much of this labour for them. Theirs was not a science of domination and classification, but one of bending and coaxing, nurturing and cajoling, or even tricking the forces of nature, to increase the likelihood of securing a favourable outcome.50 Their ‘laboratory’ was the real world of plants and animals, whose innate tendencies they exploited through close observation and experimentation. This Neolithic mode of cultivation was, moreover, highly successful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from its earliest beginnings, farming was much more than a new economy. It also saw the creation of patterns of life and ritual that remain doggedly with us millennia later, and have since become fixtures of social existence among a broad sector of humanity: everything from harvest festivals to habits of sitting on benches, putting cheese on bread, entering and exiting via doorways, or looking at the world through windows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we could put these cultural oppositions down to coincidence, or perhaps even environmental factors. But considering the close proximity of the two cultural patterns, and how the groups responsible for them exchanged goods and were keenly aware of each other’s existence, it is equally possible, and perhaps more plausible, to see what happened as the result of mutual and self-conscious differentiation, or schismogenesis,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-the-ecology-of-freedom&quot;&gt;7. The ecology of freedom&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such fluid ecological arrangements – combining garden cultivation, flood-retreat farming on the margins of lakes or springs, small-scale landscape management (e.g. by burning, pruning and terracing) and the corralling or keeping of animals in semi-wild states, combined with a spectrum of hunting, fishing and collecting activities – were once typical of human societies in many parts of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clearing gardens and orchards to grow a panoply of crops including sweet and bitter manioc, maize, tobacco, beans, cotton, groundnuts, gourds and more besides.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivation was a relaxed affair, with little effort spent on keeping different species apart. And as the dry season commenced, these tangled house gardens were abandoned altogether. The entire group dispersed into small nomadic bands to hunt and forage, only to begin the whole process again the following year, often in a different location.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the deeper history of the American tropics shows that similarly loose and flexible patterns of food production sustained civilizational growth on a continent-wide scale, long before Europeans arrived.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China follows a similar pattern. Millet-farming began on a small scale around 8000 bc, on the northern plains, as a seasonal complement to foraging and dog-assisted hunting. It remained so for 3,000 years, until the introduction of cultivated millets into the basin of the Yellow River.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-imaginary-cities&quot;&gt;8. Imaginary cities&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is always a fundamental distinction between the way one relates to friends, family, neighbourhood, people and places that we actually know directly, and the way one relates to empires, nations and metropolises, phenomena that exist largely, or at least most of the time, in our heads. Much of social theory can be seen as an attempt to square these two dimensions of our experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many early cities, there is simply no evidence of either a class of administrators or any other sort of ruling stratum. In others, centralized power seems to appear and then disappear. It would seem that the mere fact of urban life does not, necessarily, imply any particular form of political organization, and never did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious objection to evolutionary models which assume that our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship: many humans just don’t like their families very much. And this appears to be just as true of present-day hunter-gatherers as anybody else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans tend to live simultaneously with the 150-odd people they know personally, and inside imaginary structures shared by perhaps millions or even billions of other humans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have the capacity to feel bound to people we will probably never meet; to take part in a macro-society which exists most of the time as ‘virtual reality’, a world of possible relationships with its own rules, roles and structures that are held in the mind and recalled through the cognitive work of image-making and ritual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know, for instance, that in China’s Shandong province, on the lower reaches of the Yellow River, settlements of 300 hectares or more – such as Liangchengzhen and Yaowangcheng – were present by no later than 2500 bc, which is over 1,000 years before the earliest royal dynasties developed on the Central Chinese plains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar revelations are emerging from the Maya lowlands, where ceremonial centres of truly enormous size – and, so far, presenting no evidence of monarchy or stratification – can now be dated back as far as 1000 bc: more than 1,000 years before the rise of Classic Maya kings, whose royal cities were notably smaller in scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard here not to recall Ursula Le Guin’s famous short story ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas’, about the imaginary city of Omelas, a city which also made do without kings, wars, slaves or secret police. We have a tendency, Le Guin notes, to write off such a community as ‘simple’, but in fact these citizens of Omelas were ‘not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians. They were not less complex than us.’ The trouble is just that ‘we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid.’&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek city-states established colonies in the region and enslaved or made serfs of the local populations to begin with: ancient Athens was largely fed by Black Sea grain&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversity is actually remarkable, as is its sustainability. As well as wheat, barley and pulses, the citizens’ plant diet included apples, pears, cherries, sloes, acorns, hazelnuts and apricots. Mega-site dwellers were hunters of red deer, roe deer and wild boar as well as farmers and foresters. It was ‘play farming’ on a grand scale: an urban populus supporting itself through small-scale cultivation and herding, combined with an extraordinary array of wild foods.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also consider if the inhabitants of the mega-sites consciously managed their ecosystem to avoid large-scale deforestation. This is consistent with archaeological studies of their economy, which suggest a pattern of small-scale gardening, often taking place within the bounds of the settlement, combined with the keeping of livestock, cultivation of orchards, and a wide spectrum of hunting and foraging activities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumerian officials counted all sorts of things – including days, months and years – using a sexagesimal (base-60) system from which ultimately derives (via many and varied pathways of transmission) our own system of time-reckoning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems very difficult for most of us even to imagine how self-conscious egalitarianism on a large scale would work. But this again simply serves to demonstrate how automatically we have come to accept an evolutionary narrative in which authoritarian rule is somehow the natural outcome whenever a large enough group of people are brought together&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of its history Bali was divided into a series of kingdoms, endlessly squabbling over this or that. It is also famous as a rather small volcanic island which manages to support one of the densest populations on earth by a complex system of irrigated wet-rice agriculture. Yet the kingdoms seem to have had no role whatsoever in the management of the irrigation system. This was governed by a series of ‘water-temples’, through which the distribution of water was managed by an even more complex system of consensual decision-making, according to egalitarian principles, by the farmers themselves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-hiding-in-plain-sight&quot;&gt;9. Hiding in plain sight&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasizing again that we are dealing here with what is, by most estimations, one of the pivotal episodes of modern world history: the events leading directly up to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and a blueprint for subsequent European conquests throughout the Americas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were required to subordinate themselves to the people of the city. To ensure that this subordination was no mere show, each was subject to trials, starting with mandatory exposure to public abuse, regarded as the proper reward of ambition, and then – with one’s ego in tatters – a long period of seclusion, in which the aspiring politician suffered ordeals of fasting, sleep deprivation, bloodletting and a strict regime of moral instruction. The initiation ended with a ‘coming out’ of the newly constituted public servant, amid feasting and celebration. Clearly, taking up office in this indigenous democracy required personality traits very different to those we take for granted in modern electoral politics. On this latter point, it is worth recalling that ancient Greek writers were well aware of the tendency for elections to throw up charismatic leaders with tyrannical pretensions. This is why they considered elections an aristocratic mode of political appointment, quite at odds with democratic principles; and why for much of European history the truly democratic way of filling offices was assumed to be by lottery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-why-the-state-has-no-origin&quot;&gt;10. Why the state has no origin&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with no consensus among social theorists about what a state actually is, the problem is how to come up with a definition that includes all these cases but isn’t so broad as to be absolutely meaningless. This has proved surprisingly hard to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When revolutionaries win, it’s usually because the bulk of those sent to crush them refuse to shoot, or just go home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If humans were incapable of hurting each other, no one would be able to declare something absolutely sacred to themselves or to defend it against ‘all the world’. They could only exclude those who agreed to be excluded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to suggest that these three principles – call them control of violence, control of information, and individual charisma – are also the three possible bases of social power.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of sovereignty with sophisticated administrative techniques for storing and tabulating information introduces all sorts of threats to individual freedom&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet democracy, in modern states, is conceived very differently to, say, the workings of an assembly in an ancient city, which collectively deliberated on common problems. Rather, democracy as we have come to know it is effectively a game of winners and losers played out among larger-than-life individuals, with the rest of us reduced largely to onlookers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moctezuma, despite his grandeur (his palace contained everything from an aviary to quarters for troupes of comic dwarfs), was officially just the tlatoani or ‘first speaker’ in a council of aristocrats, and his empire officially a Triple Alliance of three cities. For all the bloodthirsty spectacle, the Aztec Empire was really a confederation of noble families.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inca, in contrast, insisted their sovereign was himself the incarnate Sun. All authority derived from a single point of radiance – the person of Sapa Inca (Unique Inca) himself – cascading downwards through ranks of royal siblings. The Inca court was an incubator, a hothouse for sovereignty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each newly conquered territory, the Inca immediately built a temple and forced a quota of local virgins to become ‘Brides of the Sun’: women cut off from their families, kept either as permanent virgins or dedicated to the Sapa Inca, for him to exploit and dispose of as he pleased. In consequence, the king’s subjects could be referred to collectively as ‘conquered women’, and local nobles jockeyed for position by trying to place their daughters in prominent roles at court.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the Classic Maya artistic tradition is magnificent, one of the greatest the world has ever seen. By comparison, artistic products from the ‘Post-Classic’ – as the period from roughly ad 900 to 1520 is known – often seem clumsy and less worthy of appreciation. On the other hand, how many of us would really prefer to live under the arbitrary power of a petty warlord who, for all his patronage of fine arts, counts tearing the hearts out of living human bodies among his most significant accomplishments?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a situation in which women not only command power on such a scale, but in which this power is linked to an office reserved explicitly for single women, is historically unusual. Yet this political innovation is little discussed, partly because it is already framed within an ‘intermediate’ or ‘late’ period that signals its transitory (or even decadent) nature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However much future Egyptologists would come to appreciate them, the elegance of Middle Kingdom literature like The Story of Sinuhe and the proliferation of Osiris cults likely offered little solace to the thousands of military conscripts, forced labourers and persecuted minorities of the time, many of whose grandparents were living quite peaceful lives in the preceding ‘dark ages&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the teleological habit of thought, which makes us scour the ancient world for embryonic versions of our modern nation states.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the ‘absolutist’ monarchs of the Renaissance, like Henry VIII or Louis XIV, had a great deal of trouble delegating their authority – that is, convincing their subjects to treat royal representatives as deserving anything like the same deference and obedience due to the king himself. Even if one does develop an administrative apparatus (as they of course did), there is the additional problem of how to get the administrators actually to do what they’re told – and, by the same token, how to get anyone to tell you if they aren’t.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burials of kings surrounded by dozens, hundreds, on some occasions even thousands of human victims killed specially for the occasion can be found in almost every part of the world where monarchies did eventually establish themselves, from the early dynastic city-state of Ur in Mesopotamia to the Kerma polity in Nubia to Shang China. There are also credible literary descriptions from Korea, Tibet, Japan and the Russian steppes. Something similar seems to have occurred as well in the Moche and Wari societies of South America, and the Mississippian city of Cahokia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the extension of Inca sovereignty in Peru. Here, too, we find a contrast between the traditional, varied and flexible regime of everyday foodstuffs – in this case centering on cuisine made from freeze-dried potatoes (chuño) – and the introduction of a completely different sort of food, in this case, maize beer (chicha), which was considered fit for the gods and also gradually became, as it were, the food of empire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a Classic Maya ruler (ajaw) was to be a hunter and god-impersonator of the first rank, a warrior whose body, on entering battle or during dance rituals, became host to the spirit of an ancestral hero, deity or dreamlike monsters.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shang diviners appealed to gods through the medium of burnt offerings. The process was as follows: when hosting gods or ancestors at a ritual meal, kings or their diviners put turtle shells and ox scapulae on the fire, then ‘read’ the cracks&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceedings were quite bureaucratic. Once an answer had been obtained, the diviner or an appointed scribe would then authorize the reading by etching an inscription on to bone or shell, and the resulting oracle would be stored for later consultation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the specific theory we’ve been developing here, where the three elementary forms of domination – control of violence, control of knowledge, and charismatic power – can each crystallize into its own institutional form (sovereignty, administration and heroic politics), almost all these ‘early states’ could be more accurately described as ‘second-order’ regimes of domination.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if we are trying to understand the appeal of monarchy as a form of government – and it cannot be denied that for much of recorded human history it was a very popular one – then likely it has something to do with its ability to mobilize sentiments of a caring nature and abject terror at the same time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both money and administration are based on similar principles of impersonal equivalence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fact that this equality could be viewed as making people (as well as things) interchangeable, which in turn allowed rulers, or their henchmen, to make impersonal demands that took no consideration of their subjects’ unique situations. This is of course what gives the word ‘bureaucracy’ such distasteful associations almost everywhere today. The very term evokes mechanical stupidity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the addition of sovereign power, and the resulting ability of the local enforcer to say, ‘Rules are rules; I don’t want to hear about it’ that allows bureaucratic mechanisms to become genuinely monstrous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also noted how the English word ‘free’ ultimately derives from a Germanic term meaning ‘friend’ – since, unlike free people, slaves cannot have friends because they cannot make commitments or promises.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it is often simply assumed that states begin when certain key functions of government – military, administrative and judicial – pass into the hands of full-time specialists. This makes sense if you accept the narrative that an agricultural surplus ‘freed up’ a significant portion of the population from the onerous responsibility of securing adequate amounts of food: a story that suggests the beginning of a process that would lead to our current global division of labour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, almost none of the regimes we’ve been considering in this chapter were actually staffed by full-time specialists. Most obviously, none seem to have had a standing army.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priests and judges rarely worked full-time either; in fact, most government institutions in Old Kingdom Egypt, Shang China, Early Dynastic Mesopotamia or for that matter classical Athens were staffed by a rotating workforce whose members had other lives as managers of rural estates, traders, builders or any number of different occupations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ‘the state’ means anything, it refers to precisely the totalitarian impulse that lies behind all such claims, the desire effectively to make the ritual last forever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about ‘early civilizations’ they are mostly referring to those very same societies we’ve been describing in this chapter and their direct successors: Pharaonic Egypt, Inca Peru, Aztec Mexico, Han China, Imperial Rome, ancient Greece, or others of a certain scale and monumentality. All these were deeply stratified societies, held together mostly by authoritarian government, violence and the radical subordination of women. Sacrifice, as we’ve seen, is the shadow lurking behind this concept of civilization:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve been showing throughout this book, in all parts of the world small communities formed civilizations in that true sense of extended moral communities. Without permanent kings, bureaucrats or standing armies they fostered the growth of mathematical and calendrical knowledge. In some regions they pioneered metallurgy, the cultivation of olives, vines and date palms, or the invention of leavened bread and wheat beer; in others they domesticated maize and learned to extract poisons, medicines and mind-altering substances from plants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What until now has passed for ‘civilization’ might in fact be nothing more than a gendered appropriation – by men, etching their claims in stone – of some earlier system of knowledge that had women at its centre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the Archaic phase onwards, geometric earthworks across large parts of the Americas appear to have been using the same system of measurement: one apparently based on the arrangement of cords into equilateral triangles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, not only did indigenous North Americans manage almost entirely to sidestep the evolutionary trap that we assume must always lead, eventually, from agriculture to the rise of some all-powerful state or empire; but in doing so they developed political sensibilities that were ultimately to have a deep influence on Enlightenment thinkers and, through them, are still with us today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;12-conclusion&quot;&gt;12. Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet most modern thinkers have clearly found it bizarre to attribute self-conscious social projects or historical designs to people of earlier epochs. Generally, such ‘non-modern’ folk were considered too simple-minded (not having achieved ‘social complexity’); or to be living in a kind of mystical dreamworld; or, at best, were thought to be simply adapting themselves to their environment at an appropriate level of technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional societies, according to Eliade, everything important has already happened. All the great founding gestures go back to mythic times, the illo tempore,1 the dawn of everything, when animals could talk or turn into humans, sky and earth were not yet separated, and it was possible to create genuinely new things (marriage, or cooking, or war).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of some male genius realizing his solitary vision, innovation in Neolithic societies was based on a collective body of knowledge accumulated over centuries, largely by women, in an endless series of apparently humble but in fact enormously significant discoveries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was the first person to figure out that you could make bread rise by the addition of those microorganisms we call yeasts? We have no idea, but we can be almost certain she was a woman and would most likely not be considered ‘white’ if she tried to immigrate to a European country today; and we definitely know her achievement continues to enrich the lives of billions of people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoamerican societies never employed wheeled transport; but we know they were familiar with spokes, wheels and axles since they made toy versions of them for children. Greek scientists famously came up with the principle of the steam engine, but only employed it to make temple doors that appeared to open of their own accord, or similar theatrical illusions. Chinese scientists, equally famously, first employed gunpowder for fireworks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Amerindian cannibal rituals showed the desire to take over the strength and courage of the alien so as to combat him better, the European ritual revealed the existence of a dissymmetry, an irrevocable imbalance of power.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;correspondence exists between social and spatial hierarchies. Time and again we found ourselves confronted with writing which simply assumes that the larger and more densely populated the social group, the more ‘complex’ the system needed to keep it organized. Complexity, in turn, is still often used as a synonym for hierarchy. Hierarchy, in turn, is used as a euphemism for chains of command (the ‘origins of the state’),&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how cities actually began in many parts of the world: as civic experiments on a grand scale, which frequently lacked the expected features of administrative hierarchy and authoritarian rule.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call them ‘egalitarian’, as we’ve seen, could mean quite a number of different things. It might imply an urban parliament and co-ordinated projects of social housing, as with some pre-Columbian centres in the Americas; or the self-organizing of autonomous households into neighbourhoods and citizens’ assemblies, as with prehistoric mega-sites north of the Black Sea; or, perhaps, the introduction of some explicit notion of equality based on principles of uniformity and sameness, as in Uruk-period Mesopotamia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, monarchy, warrior aristocracies or other forms of stratification could also take hold in urban contexts, and often did. When this happened the consequences were dramatic. Still, the mere existence of large human settlements in no way caused these phenomena, and certainly didn’t make them inevitable. For the origins of these structures of domination we must look elsewhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereditary aristocracies were just as likely to exist among demographically small or modest-sized groups, such as the ‘heroic societies’ of the Anatolian highlands, which took form on the margins of the first Mesopotamian cities and traded extensively with them. Insofar as we have evidence for the inception of monarchy as a permanent institution it seems to lie precisely there, and not in cities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s hard to resist the temptation to write and think as if the current state of the world, in the early twenty-first century, is the inevitable outcome of the last 10,000 years of history, while in reality, of course, we have little or no idea what the world will be like even in 2075, let alone 2150.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if our species does endure, and we one day look backwards from this as yet unknowable future, aspects of the remote past that now seem like anomalies – say, bureaucracies that work on a community scale; cities governed by neighbourhood councils; systems of government where women hold a preponderance of formal positions; or forms of land management based on care-taking rather than ownership and extraction – will seem like the really significant breakthroughs, and great stone pyramids or statues more like historical curiosities. What if we were to take that approach now and look at, say, Minoan Crete or Hopewell not as random bumps on a road that leads inexorably to states and empires, but as alternative possibilities: roads not taken?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing the scientific means to know our own past, we have exposed the mythical substructure of our ‘social science’&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A subtle and peaceful perspective on the future, where humans and robots live apart. In Becky Chambers&#x27;s fashion: mostly character and worldbuilding, little plot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becky paints a low-tech, solarpunky world where people respect each other very gently. This almost felt like a self-sabotage, because there is little story to everything being perfect. It&#x27;s this weird conundrum where we want to imagine hopeful futures, but in doing so actually forfeiting opportunities for engaging storytelling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this novella, Becky manages to tell a story nonetheless. In a world where you have everything you could ever desire, how do you actually &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happy and fulfilled? The struggle is purely internal, and Becky handles it so delicately that there is almost no room for any friction, thus also less opportunity to develop sympathy. It leads to a somewhat weaker story, in my experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all in all I find these newer directions of storytelling very fascinating. It will be an ongoing exploration to figure out how we will tell hopeful future perspectives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/coffee/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Since I’ve arrived in Amsterdam, I have been sampling coffees with more conscious attention than I had ever done before. I started grinding my own beans, and researching differences between coffee processing techniques. I’ve been visiting several different roasteries in Amsterdam, to talk with them and taste their coffees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this document I kept track of the coffee beans I have tasted and what my thoughts are about each and every one of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an extensive survey of all beans below, but to cut to the chase, here are the coffee beans I enjoyed most.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Paraìso, Diego Bermudez, Colombia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juicy Las Nubes, M&amp;amp;M micro mill, Costa Rica&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gedeb Gotiti, Gotiti Kebele, Ethiopia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-survey-of-coffee-beans&quot;&gt;A survey of coffee beans&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a comprehensive survey of coffees I bought and prepared over the period running from September 2021 to May 2022. I decided to stop updating this for every single bag of beans I bought, but I might come back to write about some special or noteworthy new coffees I taste in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paraiso Red Plum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [September 2021, April 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anaerobic, Red Plum&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Villa Esperanza, Diego Bermudez; El Tambo, Cauca; Columbia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemonade, sweet peach, juicy, complex&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought this again, but now from Badeta. I paid nearly thirty euro for 250 grams of beans, because the farmers had a bad harvest. This coffee bean is exceptionally good though. Very pleasant and complex taste. Noemi explicitly liked this one above others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&amp;amp;M Juicy Las Nubes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [September 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juicy natural, anaerobic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert Mata &amp;amp; son Michael; M&amp;amp;M Micro Mill, Dora area Terrazzo; Costa Rica&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweet, tropical punch, party&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first bags I bought since starting my small exploratory journey and they blew me away. Amazingly complex taste the likes of which my ignorant palette had never tasted before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gusto&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Bocca) [October 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethiopia &amp;amp; Peru&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk chocolate, honey, berry&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoy this one as an easy drink. It is relatively subtle, but with adventurous undertones that give you just enough kick for a casual drink.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bombe Sidama&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Cafecito) [October 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethiopia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberry, tropical fruit, lime, honey, carambola, chocolate&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the more interesting notes that invite me to consciously sample all the coffee’s complexities. The roaster promised me that this coffee was in the pipeline and that it would be really good, when I was there to drink a cup of of their &lt;strong&gt;Costa Rica Red Honey&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; earlier.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAM Huehuetenango SHB&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [October 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully washed&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various smallholders working with Unex S.A. Guatemala&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate, red apple, maple syrup&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My “first” washed coffee that I consciously buy and drink. There are clearly less sparkling &#x2F; bold &#x2F; fruity notes in its profile as a result of the processing. However, it has a really pleasant and steady taste that is easy to drink.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kainamui AB&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [November 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washed&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kainamui Fact. New Ngariama Co-op; Kenya&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweet, floral, rhubarb&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really “clean” coffee; fruity notes, acidity, not as much body. The guy from the roastery told me he likes making this with a tad finer grind to extract a bit more punch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bunto Ledo&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (LOT61) [November 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bantu Ledo, Toraja, Indonesia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red currant, green apple, syrupy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very clean too. Not much to note about it; nothing that immediately springs out as a unique property of the coffee. I do enjoy drinking it. After a sip the coffee seems to linger around my tongue a bit longer, which reminds me of syrupy qualities. I&#x27;m not sure where the currants and apples are, but I am not tasting them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus Pablo&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Stooker) [November 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washed anaerobic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Caturra, Bourbon, Typica&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huehuetenango; Guatemala&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple cider, acacia honey, nectarine&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasantly sophisticated, not as acidic, but has a certain sweetness to it. Not too crazy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacienda La Florida&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [November 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washed with Carbonic Maceration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Catucai&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacienda La Florida, Coronel Family; Sozoranga, Loja, Ecuador&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Umami, oregano, white tea&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woah it feels weird to write, but there is definitely a strong tea taste to this coffee; something herbacious if we&#x27;re speaking more generally. I also experience a chocolate after-taste around my tongue. In conclusion, I think this coffee makes me realize that I prefer something more fruity and sparkling, with a heftier punch of acidity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frinsa Estate, Lot Edun&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [December 2021]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anaerobic natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Sigararutang, Andungsari, Timtim&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frinsa Estate, Sindangkerta, Java, Indonesia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funky, intense, rhubarb syrup, lemon curd&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beans have a great aroma; really putting themselves out there. Not any of that muted business I had with the &lt;em&gt;hacienda la florida&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The taste is indeed very intense, but in a pleasant way. It wakes you up and dumps a motivation to be inspired on you. There is some sweetness too; not as much acidity. Easy drink, while it feels like there are layers and layers underneath.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roy Hernandez&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [January 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Arabica Parainema&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finca El Mandarino, Dept. de Ocotepeque, Honduras&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange, toffee, milk chocolat&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellow acidity, but a really comfortable drink.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borazon&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [January 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anaerobic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Arabica, Caturra&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luis Eduardo Campos, Tarrazu, Costa Rica&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweet and fresh, cinnamon, spices, stewed apple&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good taste and pleasing aroma, but I cannot distinguish the taste notes very distinctly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yirgacheffe&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [January 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anaerobic natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yirgacheffe, Guji region, Uraga, Ethiopia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delicate, clean, stonefruit, bright red fruits&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very enjoyable and clean taste. I cannot help but think that my grind and preparation might me muddling the coffee though. It should have a much clearer profile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gedeb Gotiti&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Stooker) [February 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotiti Kebele, Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried strawberries, whipped cream, blackcurrant&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want out of a natural coffee. Good amount of funkiness and acidity, though I still suspect my equipment is suboptimally extracting the boldest flavors. At least it gives me that desired experience of &quot;I didn&#x27;t know coffee could taste like this&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaffa&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Kaffa) [February 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kefa, Ethiopia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;no taste notes were provided&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half as expensive as most other coffee beans from roasteries around town, this one reminds me the most of Douwe Egberts generics. It tastes of roast, but not much more that I can discern.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ismael Navarro&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [February 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anaerobic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Catuai Amarillo&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ismale Navarro, Luis Campos Mill, Costa Rica&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookie dough, marsipan, spice&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These beans are really good. A touch of sweetness, not too much acidity, but still enjoyably complex.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidney Portilho Double Fermentation&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [March 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12h aerobic + 10h anaerobic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Yellow Catuai&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidney Portilho, Matas de Minas, Brazil&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tropical fruits, pistachio, clean&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let the people at Rum Baba grind fifty grams for me, so that I can compare it to my own grinds. It tastes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; clean, nothing funky, little acidity (that sensation curling around the tongue).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colombian Emerald&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Simon Lévelt) [March 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;no processing information provided&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Arabica&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colombia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandarine, caramel, pineapple&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listed as specialty coffee (bought it from Albert Heijn), but it is similar in experience to the Douwe Egberts coffee beans that I tried. The aroma is actually quite pleasant; that is why I opted for a light roast in the first place. However, after brewing a cup with my V60 pour-over, the first sips tasted of cardboard. I had this same association with DE. Both remain a relatively one-dimensional cup of coffee with the unpleasant hints of heavy artificial paper-based products.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Salvador Carlos Pola Black Honey&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [March 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black honey anaerobic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Arabica; Bourbon variety&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apaneca Illametepec mountain range, El Salvador&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate, black berry, umami&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very pleasant and really clear chocolate notes. The aroma breathes chocolate the most.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peru Lupuna&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Badeta) [April 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washed&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Caturra, Costarica95&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tsachopen Oxapampa, Peru&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaakwiel: body, kruidig, zoet, notig&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A step up from the &quot;clean drinks&quot; by providing a bit more herbal or spicy tastes. Good drink, but not as funky as the Paraiso.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicaragua Un Regalo de Dios&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Rum Baba) [April 2022]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beans: Pacamara&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luis Alberto Balladarez Moncada, Finca Un Regalo de Dios, Mozonte, Nueva Segovia, Nicaragua&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hug in a mug, sweet and smooth, dried prunes&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfortably smooth, can&#x27;t discern specific notes, besides its sweetness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coffee is indeed pretty delicate. One of the people at Rum Baba told me that it is often difficult to extract the characteristic notes from truly exclusive specialty coffees, thus often not warranting the high price. This coffee is apparently a bit easier to extract. There are very strong jasmine tea tastes. It reminds me of the Hacienda La Florida that I bought last november. I resolve that these delicate tea tastes are not my preferred coffee varieties.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>From frisbee happiness to future memories</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/ultimate-happiness/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;After returning from a friendly ultimate frisbee tournament this weekend, I realized how happy it made me feel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole weekend was spent outside in the sunny weather, playing sports and games that I love. The friendliness of the frisbee community sets an incredibly chill atmosphere. By moving and playing so much, my consciousness is completely taken away from normal life to fully dedicate its sensory inputs to experiencing what is happening right here and right now. It might sound like a flow state. In any case, I think it is goal-worthy to try to pursue moments in life that facilitate this captivating quality of enjoyment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also joys me to see myself be the strongest that I have ever been, even though my knees are slightly permanently damaged and I am still struggling to accept that. The work I have put into calisthenics training over the years has built me more capable of controlling and manipulating my body. It is truly fascinating to see what I am capable of sometimes. While still practicing the balance for my handstand, I was surprised to notice that I could offer helpful tips to others to improve their upside-down balancing acts. Being outside and pushing our bodies to perform tricks and endurance tests feels so incredibly satisfying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my journey back to Amsterdam I was still riding a happiness high that put me in a meditative state. Zipping through Wageningen and its surroundings made me reflect on memories from years ago, when I often traveled here to see Kyra. Those memories are emotionally very powerful. At times they might even make me feel sad or melancholic, because all of those happy moments appear to have been gone forever without any opportunity for me to experience it again. In part, this is true, of course. I won&#x27;t ever experience it exactly the same again. But this is also not the real problem, I think. The truly terrifying part is that the future is so uncertain. Will I ever experience moments so beautiful and meaningful again?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am reflecting on these again, I find it interesting to notice which moments actually bubble up from memory. Those are the moments when we were going grocery shopping on Kyra&#x27;s only bike together, cycling up the hill again, walking around the Arboretum with the setting sun, hearing the subtle peace and natural interwovenness of Wageningen, gathering for board game nights in Kyra&#x27;s room, swimming in the Rhine on lazy summer days. My memories are mostly from outside experiences; moments actively taking in engaging environments and dynamic signals. I think therein lies a good lesson for how I want to live my life meaningfully.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though reflecting on those memories might make me feel nostalgic, I have also come to realize that new memories and experiences will happen. Nevermind how uncertain the future might be, I am learning to trust that I will find myself in many more meaningful moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not only chance that brings us into those moments, naturally. This weekend also made me realize that there are so many possible futures that I could pursue. If I just talked with this person a bit longer, or if I approached this other person instead of lingering around somewhere. So many life experiences originate from small interactions with humans. And there is no need to feel pressure, it often just flows organically. But it does pay off to actively think and act on the interactions you enjoy. And then, these interactions can lead to amazing journeys, travels, hobbies, passions, friendships, and love. This is visualized nicely by Tim Urban&#x27;s illustration:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;assets&#x2F;img&#x2F;tim-urban-life-paths.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Life paths&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see Derek Sivers&#x27;s book on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sive.rs&#x2F;h&quot;&gt;how to live&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&#x27;ve read and listened to small fragments, and its words are very inspiring. A small taste:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask the meaning of life, they&#x27;re looking for a story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is no story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a billion little moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#x27;re not a part of anything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An incredibly beautiful denunciation of the Vietnam war, through Hainish analogy. Subtly but unambiguously captures raw human brutality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula excels in literary and emotional science fiction. I&#x27;ve &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;orsinian-tales&quot;&gt;previously written&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that this sometimes gets in the way of the plot and impact of a story, but none of that is true for this book. &lt;em&gt;The word for world is forest&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; reads like a prolonged punch in the gut. It hurts to read through the no-frills build-up of human cruelty, not trying to mask any of the evils people are capable of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is predictable but still heart-wrenching. The violence and death spread by the humans from Earth on this forest planet corrupt all life irreversibly. From time to time, the story hints at fascinatingly deep societal aspects of the native human population, never exploring it fully or technically. I am made to feel wonder and astonishment and curiosity with respect to these people. But Ursula only lets this serve the feeling of oppressiveness of imperialistic colonialism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aworkinglibrary.com&#x2F;reading&#x2F;word-for-world-is-forest&quot;&gt;A Working Library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is an indictment, as sharp against the throat as any knife can be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the introduction written by Ken Macleod:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] the novel&#x27;s revolutionary defeatism doesn&#x27;t fall into the trap of romanticising the revolt of the oppressed. The Athsheans are changed by the very act of fighting, new and strange to them; the world they win back is not the same as the world that was taken from them; and their fight is not fair, or discriminating, or by the rules. It is dirty and brutal and shocking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Watching NVIDIA&#x27;s GTC keynote, and realizing that these graphic cards have become so powerful that they are bottlenecked by the rate at which NICs can ingest data. This in turn is bottlenecked by the CPU. Thus the solution is to forego the conventional method entirely and just DMA it from the NIC right into the GPU. Crazy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When robots become more ubiquitous in human environments, they will have been trained in simulated worlds. The AI models controlling them have lived through centuries of training, and all of their skills will transfer exceptionally well to the real-world robot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Ted writes surgically precise sci-fi, and he does it by blending credible science and deeply human emotional beats. Its effects did inspire less imagination in me than JLB&#x27;s work, however.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a short story collection, and since I recently took to jotting down my thoughts directly on the paper of the book I will just re-tell them here, albeit a little fleshed out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tower-of-babylon&quot;&gt;Tower of Babylon&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story breathes surgical precision in formulations and plot structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to me as a clever metaphor for the goallessness of life. What are we striving towards but the never-ending build of a tower to reach the heavens. The main character is surprised to see people living in the tower without ever having set foot on the earth, but this is us. We are born amidst a moving world, never having witnessed fundamental creation. We are obsessed with striving towards ideals---a perfect self, a peaceful and plentiful world---but we die before reaching any. We live somewhere along the impossibly tall tower of Babylon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion felt a bit &quot;tell&quot;, with the main character just acting as a mouthpiece of the author. But after all, this is only Ted&#x27;s first published story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;understand&quot;&gt;Understand&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ingenious exploration of a realistically enhanced human, this story has great potential for unreliable-narrator vibes. The narrator is ADHD-esque, obsessed with his own possibilities, hopping from thing to thing, excited about his capacities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much more for me to learn about the human body. E.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pheromone&quot;&gt;pheromones&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; actually exist, but they sound exceptionally sci-fi.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story reminds me that I should read that book by Bill Bryson: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;oclc&#x2F;1202771825&quot;&gt;The Body: A guide of occupants&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;division-by-zero&quot;&gt;Division by zero&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful exploration of mental hardships in a relationship, with a mathematically-flavoured theme.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this even science fiction? Yes, though some people might not expect it. Science fiction is not just a genre; it includes all existing genres within itself. Kind of like the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Universal_set&quot;&gt;Universal set&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, leading to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russell%27s_paradox&quot;&gt;Russell&#x27;s paradox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;story-of-your-life&quot;&gt;Story of your life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the short story that was adapted into Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I re-watched the film and then read this story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is beautiful. Ted&#x27;s precise style works incredibly well for it. Expertly woven threads, of which I trust that they will be resolved in entanglement to great satisfaction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just feels very secure to be guided through the story by Ted, thanks to his mastery of writing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the film did feel unelegantly expository. The ending of the text makes more &quot;sense&quot;, but is a bit sizzly---as in, it slowly extinguishes without a big, satisfying climax.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the text&#x27;s ending feels weirdly unsatisfactory, where the film gives some kind of purpose to the heptapods that fit their nature very well. The text does nothing to interpret the heptapods&#x27; motivation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;seventy-two-letters&quot;&gt;Seventy-two letters&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very nicely built up to a chilling turn in pseudo-scientific racial directions, when Lord Fieldhurst reveals his deeper motives of which he is internally convinced will serve only benign goals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made me think a bit on how Ted writes. At some point, he might have developed a fascinating, subversive idea, but to make it work in a story, he has to build it up. In comes the human, with motivations of their own, but still relatively ignorant of some greater implications of the system. This gives a good framework for thinking about stories. The exploration of your sci-fi worlds will flow naturally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hell-is-the-absence-of-god&quot;&gt;Hell is the absence of god&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical realism and fundamental inequality in the world of god and angels. When god becomes concrete and palpable, the world does not actually become a better place. The randomness introduced by miracles perpetuates inequality, suffering, and rivalry. Angel visitations are natural disasters with all respectively ensuing shenanigans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;liking-what-you-see-a-documentary&quot;&gt;Liking what you see: a documentary&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framing this story as a documentary---a sequence of short monologues of in-world people---is a great way to slowly expose the worldbuilding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agnosia for voice intonations and facial expressions already become way more dystopian. Especially because of this underexplored subset of deepfake technology to optimize and refine persuasive qualities of a recording of one&#x27;s voice or body.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main argument around which this story revolves is a familiar one. In the same way that refined coca leaves turn into the highly addictive cocaine that hijacks our bodies much more effectively, Ted&#x27;s story argues that natural beauty of human faces can be hypertuned by commercial industries to exploit our human psychological inclinations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were never meant to see so much beauty in our lives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;h2 id=&quot;tteokbokki&quot;&gt;Tteokbokki&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tteokbokki&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a dish of simmered rice cakes. I had bought a bag of frozen rice cake noodles from a large grocery store some time ago, and only later did I discover its popularity in Korean cuisine. Luckily I did already have some &lt;em&gt;gochujang&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (Korean chili paste) on hand, which is a very common ingredient in this dish. Though the gochujang is actually more sweet and less spicy than I expected it to be. Alas, we can always tweak our spice levels if we feel the need.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now I am not including a picture yet, because the one I took when I first made tteokbokki  was terribly wintery (i.e., no daylight, ugly lamps). It&#x27;s starting to turn to summer in Amsterdam again though, so when I prepare the dish anew I will be sure to snap a nice and light photograph.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tteokbokki is quite simple to prepare. Two good sources are &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tteokbokki&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maangchi.com&#x2F;recipe&#x2F;tteokbokki&quot;&gt;Maangchi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (who appears to be insanely popular in online cooking culture).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simmer kombu in some water and remove it after ten minutes or so. Stir in the rice cakes, gochujang, and chili flakes. Gentrly simmer until the sauce starts to thicken and the rice cakes turn soft (they won&#x27;t fall apart and will remain incredibly chewy). Around the end I put in some bok choy to fill out the dish a bit more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Korean vegetable pancakes with wasabi mayonaise, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are savory pancakes. Naturally, they come in many variations (of fillings). My kimchi was still fermenting, so we made a vegetable jeon instead. Of course &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maangchi.com&#x2F;recipe&#x2F;yachaejeon&quot;&gt;Maangchi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has a good write-up on this dish. Also read the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jeon_(food)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; article.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finely julienne napa cabbage, carrot, and spring onion. Add a tin of sweet corn. Mix in flour and water (1:1 ratio) until it forms a thick, pourable batter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat plenty of oil (really, it should be &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) in a pan. Pour in a few glucks of batter and spread it out. Fry on both sides.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve the jeon, garnished with a whisking of mayonaise and wasabi paste, and a few drops of soy sauce on top.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The power lines across the Middenweg were singing while swinging in the wind and rain. These otherwordly chants melted together with my inner peace from post-sauna bliss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;These short stories are beautifully efficient metaphysical explorations coated in deliciously erudite magical realism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borges conveys the same imagination and creativity that other writers manage to put down over the course of hundreds of pages, in sheer tens instead. He is brilliant in formulating dense stories that showcase his erudite understanding of European literature and history, which would be extremely impressive for the best of European writers, but this man also hails from Argentina. Reading his work with only half an eye is neither doing Borges nor yourself justice. His collected fiction remains ripe for many re-readings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borges stories are unique, with regards to pieces of fiction, insofar as their ability to conjure major life ponderings within me. At times it felt akin to the philosophical out-of-the box engagement with my own mind that psychedelics may give me. This makes the choice to use M.C. Escher&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Other World&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as cover illustration for my 2000 Penguin edition even more apt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploads2.wikiart.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;m-c-escher&#x2F;other-world.jpg!Large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Other World by M.C. Escher&quot; &gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Borges&#x27;s stories play with perspective. He places us into individuals or beasts without our knowledge, and over the course of the story he slowly unravels the thoughts and feelings until we start realizing that we are in a place we know all too well. Either from mythology, religion, or simply life itself. Borges is masterful at rationing knowledge and information to build maximal tension and interest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction written by translator Andrew Hurley makes me want to start my own literary magazines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Borges afterword:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man sets out to draw the world. As the years go by, he peoples a space with images of provinces, kingdoms, mountains, bays, ships, islands, fishes, rooms, instruments, stars, horses, and individuals. A short time before he dies, he discovers that that patient labyrinth of lines traces the lineaments of his own face.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;The Other Death&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about Illescas, Tupambae, Masoller, and did so with such perfectly formed periods, and so vividly, that I realized that he&#x27;d told these same stories many times before -- it all made me fear that behind his words hardly any memories remained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There appears to be an ordinally more miserable misery in fiction. On the one hand, dystopia summon terrible circumstances that no one wishes even upon their enemies. But these are external factors. To actually &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; miserable, we must turn inward and experience deep melancholy that saddens and disappoints the now. No one but ourselves can destroy our hopes and joy. And we are utterly good at it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading Jorge Luis Borges (&lt;em&gt;Mutations&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was direct inspiration).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;What are some possibilities of avatars in a metaverse? Will they be backed by AI that is intimately familiar with personal individuals to a degree that it can act as a conversational substitute in meetings? Will they be able to summarize the most important points and decisions after the meeting has been concluded? We are going to lend increasing amounts of agency to these avatars. To exercise useful agency requires  access to personal calendars, communication history, and work documents. Furthermore, to sell the conversational substitutionalism, avatars are going to use deepfake technology to simulate our human presence via image and voice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A fast-paced and enjoyable story in West African environments fresh to the fantasy genre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after I had read a couple of chapters, did I realize that this book is actually written for a young adult audience. When first shelving the book, and later picking it up to start reading, this fact hadn&#x27;t registered in my mind yet. I generally don&#x27;t read many children&#x2F;YA books anymore, even though I admire many of the works I have read in my own childhood and recognize that pieces written for these audiences tend to be surprising and good in totally fresh ways. &lt;em&gt;Raybearer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is heavily character-driven and gives us a tightly plotted story. In my experience, this gives it the oh-so-desirable quality of un-put-downable-ty that I love in series like Harry Potter. In addition to this, Jordan makes us feel wonder and amazement at West African-inspired fantasy landscapes and cultures. There are tasty descriptions of food, which is a big plus in my hypothetical personal rating system. Characters felt a bit too shallow and clear-cut in their motivations to me. I realize this might be a necessary feature inherent to writing for YA. In the end, I found reading this book to be a addictively wholesome investment of my time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When his last leaf of truffle parsley disintegrated, he knew he would die soon. Even though his sous-vide yellow octopus was cooked perfectly at the razor-thin edge of done-ness, and the once-in-a-century smoky cassave was salivatingly well fried; he had failed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other competitors would not have lost consciousness long enough to fuck up the vital ingredient of a vinaigrette. Others would be more perfect than him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He felt his artifical neurons firing for one last time. And then he wasn&#x27;t him anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I found this book to be a beautiful journey towards grasping human meaning. Victor offers a truly insightful and utterly human account of his experiences in concentration camps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inmate-s-mental-reactions-to-camp-life&quot;&gt;The inmate&#x27;s mental reactions to camp life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his account, Victor weaves a backbone of three psychological phases of man in these second world war nazi concentration camps; directly after arrival, when man has become entrenched in camp life, and the period following his release.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People experienced intense shock at the terrible conditions and the humiliating treatment. They experience a &lt;em&gt;delusion of reprieve&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (hoping against all evidence that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; will be spared). These hopes will be crushed and ultimately people will no longer fear death anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional apathy&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor describes how any human reaction to a camp&#x27;s circumstances (disgust, horror, pity, longing) were systematically punished. This had as effect that the deadening of these normal reactions was hastened, leading to a state of emotional apathy. Victor describes haunting scenarios throughout his writing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depersonalization&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When man would finally be liberated, he had to go out into the world again and face the realities of his hopes that carried him through all horrors. Victor identifies two psychological consequences: bitterness and disillusionment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;meaning-and-logotherapy&quot;&gt;Meaning and logotherapy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some notes from the second part of the book, where Victor introduces his field of logotherapy and discusses the question of the meaning of life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can take away everything, but a man will always be able to choose his attitude. This inner choice or achievement is a spiritual freedom that makes life meaningful and purposeful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor quotes the same phrase by Nietzsche on multiple occasions throughout the book:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who has a &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to live for, can bear with almost any &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From page 85:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who are being questioned by life--daily and hourly.
Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct.
Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answers to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each indvidual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, these tasks differ from man to man and from moment to moment, making it impossible to generally capture &lt;em&gt;the&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; meaning of life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of logotherapy is the concept of &lt;em&gt;existential vacuum&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of one&#x27;s life. This often springs from boredom. Man wishes to do what other people do (conformism), or what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism). Victor predicts that future progressive automation will lead to an increase of leisure hours, which might enlarge the impact of existential vacuums for many people. I myself have been thinking about how our work weeks should be shortened and more conscious effort should be put into activities that humans are proven to enjoy more. This makes me realize that it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; important that people are educated and inspired sufficiently to act on these insights and not get trapped in capitalistically-induced local minima.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The categorical imperative of logotherapy is beautiful:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to logotherapy, we can discover meaning in life in three ways. Namely, by:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a work or doing a deed&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiencing something or encountering someone&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor elaborates on the meaning of love:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.
Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities.
By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Do we confuse &quot;deep&quot; conversations with meaningful relationships? Why does it sometimes feel more meaningful to be talking &lt;em&gt;about&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a relationship instead of experiencing things together? I&#x27;m guessing it is partly a matter of conscious attention given to the moment (i.e., talking about a relationship forces one to really consciously reflect on the inter-human connection)..&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The original English editions are beautifully and eloquently written, to a degree that is rare in current works of fantasy, partly because it signifies a more formal bygone time of the previous century.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories from Middle-Earth always manage to conjure a nostalgic set of memories within me; how I used to drop by my best friend&#x27;s house every week-end to go on adventures, watch The Lord of the Rings films over and over again, eating dinner underneath their grapevines in sweltering summers, petting their way too heavy cat Flip, running through their large house, drawing in the attic workspace of his dad, and so many more rich and fond memories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seem to have all become mixed up in any revisiting of the primary works of Tolkien, even though I did not read the actual books until I was fourteen or fifteen. And when I did, I tore through them all in seven days, during a trip to the south of France. Am I even making new memories when re-reading these works or will they keep on telling me the same stories for ever?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Tolkien&#x27;s work is a slow read, it captures me wholesomely when I give it proper attention. Reading it thus becomes like sizzling in a warm bath, thoroughly enjoying the moment in time itself, without worrying about anything else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once read about someone who decided that the Lord of the Rings series would be their re-reading series of choice for the remainder of their life. They then read the books again every year. This had been going on for a couple of decades. I can partly extrapolate the appeal of this, similar to how I personally enjoy re-reading the Harry Potter series. At the same time I feel like I am too young to start re-living my life. There exists a trend that people mostly continue to listen to the music from their twenties without discovering many new works after a certain age. But I am not in that stage yet. Furthermore, the number of amazing works being published in recent years and the coming time greatly exceeds what ever has been available to anyone before. I can no longer afford to remain stuck in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; golden era like older people could; the quality and diversity of publications now deserves all my recognition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to just read LotR once and then look ahead to all the wonderful modern classics being published right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been thinking that rituals are important in dedicating full attention to an act, which in turn plays a role in to what extent we perceive it as meaningful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second dimension is the distinction between religious&#x2F;cultural rituals and &lt;em&gt;biological&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; rituals (Yuval Noah Harari: e.g., the ritual of &lt;em&gt;a first kiss&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Stockholm is dark and busy. Street noise everywhere, nothing like the more peaceful Helsinki. I&#x27;m spending time in cafés, aiming to work but being distracted by interesting people living their own complex lives. Opposite of me sits a slender young girl with wild short blonde hair, legs pulled up on the seat. She&#x27;s on the phone but not talking, instead softly crying and sniffing. Her boyfriend sits right beside her, but is listening to music and making his homework.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a table to the side sits a French girl with dark brown dreadlocks, wearing clear framed glasses. Her clothes are pastelle-coloured and she&#x27;s spending hours going through Google Docs comments and discussions. She definitely looks like Dr. Liet-Kynes from the recent &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; film.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boyfriend of the slender girl is comforting her now, tenderly holding her slim frame and drying her tears. The girl is fidgeting with her nails while staring into an endless abyss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days in winter in the Nordics feel short. Life blurs together, unless I make a conscious effort to observe and not get pulled into mental tunnels. It feels easy to keep my head ducked and get through winter quickly, but that is akin to an uninteresting life. I am sometimes struggling to experience excitement. I might have developed an allergy for winter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Jemisin does not mess around and writes short stories that pack a punch and hit their story beats very efficiently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed many of the stories in this book, which is high praise for short story collections in my experience. I got this book as a paper hardcover and I started writing down my thoughts at the beginning of every story after I finished it. The feel of writing with black ink in a paper book is something peculiar. It feels wrong on many levels, but rationally it just makes sense to keep my notes and thoughts as close to the source as possible. Only later do I want to synthesize these into something more coherent. And that time is now, so here we go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I did not annotate my thoughts for every story. The collection contains more than I treat here. These are just my thoughts and personal recommendations.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief-thoughts-on-almost-all-short-stories&quot;&gt;Brief thoughts on almost all short stories&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;l-alchimista&quot;&gt;L&#x27;Alchimista&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good and engaging short story about food and cooking?! Don&#x27;t see this type of works often, but I am all for it. Very enjoyable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-effluent-engine&quot;&gt;The Effluent Engine&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story telling mechanics are laid out very clearly in this story, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because they certainly deliver. Nice and adventurous tale with many sides.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-trojan-girl&quot;&gt;The Trojan Girl&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, interesting concept; anthropomorphizing computer code. However, the jumble of terms did not always make sense, which is fine for someone who is not as familiar with these, but it gets those with a more in-depth background out of the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;valedictorian&quot;&gt;Valedictorian&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice example of how you can play with the audience and develop tension by gradually releasing information about the story&#x27;s perspective (i.e., from the main character&#x27;s point-of-view).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-brides-of-heaven&quot;&gt;The Brides of Heaven&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good exercise of laying out a story in a single conversation in just one room (admittedly, &lt;em&gt;with&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; some flashbacks). This piece treats themes that a male science fiction writer would almost never touch; i.e, motherhood and child-bearing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evaluators&quot;&gt;The Evaluators&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really nice and subtle twist at the end. Very interesting perspective on believable space exploration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;walking-awake&quot;&gt;Walking awake&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creepy and dystopian, with apt social criticism. Jenkins is angry. And writings like these serve as a controlled vent to blow off steam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cuisine-des-memoires&quot;&gt;Cuisine des Mémoires&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant short story; amazing concept. I am really enjoying these food stories. Admittedly, the reveal in the end did not entirely live up to the setup, though I still found it satisfying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;stone-hunger&quot;&gt;Stone Hunger&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did not finish this one; failed to capture my attention in the beginning. I was making a train journey in a quite busy wagon at the time I attempted to read this story though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-banks-of-the-river-lex&quot;&gt;On the Banks of the River Lex&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if I understood this story properly. It presents a nicely weird perspective on an apocalypse, but I did not find it very engaging.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-narcomancer&quot;&gt;The Narcomancer&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid worldbuilding; stuff makes sense. The character conflicts are clear, which is key in these short stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;henosis&quot;&gt;Henosis&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very effective despite its short length. Prime example of building tension through &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; time skips (i.e., reordering chapters).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;too-many-yesterdays-not-enough-tomorrows&quot;&gt;Too Many Yesterdays, Not Enough tomorrows&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apocalyps for everyone with real feelings, where the only survivors are 2000-era bloggers. Weirdly nostalgic feelings for a period I did not live through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-you-train&quot;&gt;The You Train&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting format that keeps moving &#x2F; progressing, which makes it pleasurable to follow. The story pertains to life in busy cities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-zero-probabilities&quot;&gt;Non-Zero Probabilities&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this story to be a bit boring; there was not much going on and there were no real character conflicts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommended-readings&quot;&gt;Recommended readings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every short story collection is a mixed bag of pieces with varying values on the scale of personal engagement, almost per definition. The ones I enjoyed most are the following three stories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L&#x27;Alchimista&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Effluent Engine&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cuisine des Mémoires&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

        <title>The four films I saw at IDFA today</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/best-of-idfa/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;The International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam is coming to an end and I bought a ticket to see four of the awarded films in a single afternoon. When I biked to the city center cinema it was still sunny  outside, but later in the day it became rainy and dreary. I walked across the flower market with some food in between two films, and my fingers noticed that the winds through town had also become icily cold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my thoughts on the four films, which I wrote down immediately after their screenings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-are-we-headed&quot;&gt;Where are we headed?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This documentary tries to give us a feel for Russian culture and society by solely presenting us with footage from the Moscow metro system. Its vibes are gray, lonely, disillusioned. But also militant, proud. In private spaces, women seem stronger than men.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting such a documentary, but it turned out insightful and interesting. Though there isn&#x27;t much of a story to speak of, I felt a sense of progression. Especially when we ultimately take a train to the sunny, outside world. Simple sunlight had never seemed as welcome as it did right then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;children-of-the-mist&quot;&gt;Children of the mist&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A look at archaic ways of living of the Hmong people in Northern Vietnam. Poor farmers with little to no future prospects and limited global perspective. The film mostly follows Di; a teenage girl with parents who are perpetually drunk, in her village which is composed of friends and other people they farm with. The scenery is beautiful, with mountainous areas and terraced fields of rice and other crops. Opening shots capture the mist rolling in surprisingly swiftly through the hills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, &quot;kidnappings&quot; of girls are relatively common. Men get drunk and then kidnap teenage girls they want to marry. This happened to Di&#x27;s older sister La, who then had to drop out of school. Two babies at 17 and living with her husband&#x27;s family.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see Di living her life as a kid, innocently. Until she too is kidnapped by a guy not much older than her after a Lunar New Year&#x27;s celebration. The guy&#x27;s called Vang. Di is gone for a day or two and then Vang&#x27;s whole family comes over to negotiate marriage terms. This all happens shamefully tongue-in-cheek; really cheaply, to my perception. Just like that, you can be married off to a different family in a few days, never to be seen again in your own village.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di escapes to her school, and that is when her teachers start getting involved. They make their way over to the family&#x27;s house to explain that it is illegal in Vietnam for underage girls to marry. While the teachers are there, both families seem to have a sort of respectful reverence towards them, but as soon as they are gone, both families fall back into a sort of acceptance of the marriage; &quot;as long as it is the kids&#x27; choice&quot;. Though this is nonsensical, as the boy Vang seems to have been fully brainwashed into believing that this is his way of being a man and doing something for his poor family.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di&#x27;s is almost kidnapped right in front of the camera out of her house and it takes kicking and screaming for them to let her go, so that she and Vang can &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; drink the &quot;breakup wine&quot;. These scenes were very heavy and emotionally-laden, with the filmmaker even starting to get involved when she shouts at Di&#x27;s mother to do something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole film&#x27;s undertone clearly stresses the importance of two things:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General education, and&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcohol&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies need more of the former and less of the latter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film is really well done, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-with-fire&quot;&gt;Writing with fire&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentary about an all-female newspaper&#x2F;digital news outlet. Most journalists working there are also from the population group placed &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the caste system; the &lt;em&gt;Dalit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Their organization is called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;KhabarLahariyaDigital&#x2F;videos&quot;&gt;Khabar Lahariya&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (mainly operating a YouTube channel and a Facebook page).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We experience their shift to digital reporting and their growing influence in Uttar Pradesh. They focus on conducting journalism truly as a fourth pillar of democracy and they refuse to play the games via more traditional ways. They also focus on often neglected issues such as rape and murder cases of lower caste people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a persistent power against women&#x27;s freedom throughout the whole Indian society and its systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of this women-led newspaper is inspiring and hopeful, though not as emotionally or personally touching as the previous film.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;octopus&quot;&gt;Octopus&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dialogues, monologues, pluralogues. No characters. This film is a silent observation of the damage after the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2020_Beirut_explosion&quot;&gt;2020 Beirut explosion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at the port. It is months after the tragedy, but the city is littered with rubble and dust. Houses, shops, everything; broken in at least one way. We observe how Beirut&#x27;s people slowly—almost dispiritedly—rebuild their world. The film made me feel slightly bored, which I think is a novel way of trying to convey the undescribable emotions mixed up in such an event. It really forced me to work through this sense of hopelesness for an hour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Here is an idea of how heaven smells: heat a drop of olive oil in a pan, then toast a mix of almond slivers, salt, pepper, and &lt;em&gt;baharat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Baharat is this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baharat&quot;&gt;Middle Eastern mixture&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of allspice, cinnamon, coriander, black- and white peppercorns, ginger, cloves, nutmeg (and possibly other spices).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Miso soup with tofu and spring onions for lunch, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off this wonderfully delicate and interesting cuisine with a very simple dish.
A light miso soup, together with rice, serves as a staple food for the mornings in Japan.
For dinner, I will be bulking the dish out with leafy vegetables, noodles, and tofu.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few resources I enjoyed while preparing.
Kenji&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;U_Y9BUP3VVI&quot;&gt;video on miso soup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is very insightful, as usual.
And there is the delightful &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justonecookbook.com&#x2F;homemade-miso-soup&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Just One Cookbook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; post on this dish.
I will remember Namiko Hirasawa Chen&#x27;s great website for future dives into the Japanese cuisine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years I have cooked a variety of Japanese food already.
There is that time I made a ramen broth from scratch with a friend.
And other times we rolled our own sushi.
These past experiences provide some springboards for future research directions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miso soup builds on top of a broth called &lt;em&gt;dashi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, so we will make that first.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill a pot with water and put in kombu (1% of the water).
Kombu are strips of dried kelp (a specific order of seaweed), it is a natural source of &lt;em&gt;umami&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.
Once evidently simmering, take the pan off the heat and stir in katsuobushi (also 1% of water quantity).
Katsuobushi are dried bonito flakes, thus strictly speaking we&#x27;re not eating vegetarian today.
Let the flakes steep for about ten minutes, similar to how we would with tea.
Pour the broth through a sieve to filter out the kombu and katsuobushi and save them for later to make furikake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring around three hundred milliliters of broth per serving to a simmer.
This time I did not have any denser ingredients, but in principle we would add those in while starting to heat up the broth.
Instead, once the broth got simmering, I added some udon noodles and chopped napa cabbage to the pot.
Let it continue for a few minutes more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this phase we will be adding our miso paste.
I used a shinshu miso (yellow to light brown; longer fermentation than a white miso) with decreased sodium.
With roughly twenty grams per serving (three hundred milliliters), stir in small amounts at a time making sure to incorporate everything first.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the miso swirled in, I added a small block of firm tofu cut into small cubes.
Stir everything carefully and let bubble to a desired temperature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served my miso soup in a large wooden bowl while longing for the spring onion garnish that wasn&#x27;t able to be formed from my pantry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;furikake&quot;&gt;Furikake&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Dried and seasoned kombu and katsuobushi flakes meant for seasoning rice and other dishes, Amsterdam, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the leftover kombu and katsuobushi I made this &quot;rice seasoning&quot; inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justonecookbook.com&#x2F;homemade-furikake-rice-seasoning&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Just One Cookbook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Cut the kombu into small pieces and put them into a small saucepan along with the katsuobushi, still moist.
Over low heat, cook until the katsuobushi starts to separate a bit.
Add a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and salt.
Let this simmer slowly until all of the liquid has evaporated.
Continue for just a while longer — treading carefully — to crisp up the flakes and kombu.
Get them out of the pot and onto a flat sheet to let them cool.
We can now sprinkle them with sesame seeds and nori.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furikake can be used to season rice, noodles, onigiri (TODO), avocado, egg, and plenty of other dishes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Vegetable gyoza, Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noemi and I made vegetable gyoza for dinner. She had made hundreds of these before, so I was humbly learning from her experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justonecookbook.com&#x2F;vegetable-gyoza&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Just One Cookbook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; formed a good external resource.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gyoza are pan-fried dumplings. The steps for preparation are roughly as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finely mince all ingredients for the filling.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir fry the filling and add sauces near the end.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare dough for the wrappers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roll, fill, and fold the wrappers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fry and steam a batch of gyoza in a pan.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a good number of ingredients for our filling:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rehydrated shiitake mushrooms&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crumbled tofu&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cabbage&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrots&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onion&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garlic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ginger&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miso&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soy sauce&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sesame oil&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items in &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; form the seasoning sauce.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gyoza wrappers are made from dough with 50% hydration. Mix flour and water, knead for a good ten minutes, and let it rest for thirty minutes or so. Cut small pieces and flatten then roll out into a round wrapper. Lightly dust with cornstarch on both sides for more crispiness and stickiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to cut up all the vegetables in similarly small pieces. Stir fry until softened and a good deal of moisture has evaporated. Mix in seasonings and simmer for a few minutes. Take out of the pan and let it cool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place a little filling on a wrapper. Bring opposite sides of the wrapper to each other, press the top together. Work your way to both sides one-by-one, folding one side and then attaching it to the other side, creating the ribbled top. The folds are mostly performed by your thumbs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With eight pieces folded, we were ready to fry a batch. Heat a few tablespoons of oil and place all eight gyoza in a pan. After a minute, their bottoms should have crisped. Throw a few tablespoons of water in the pan and cover with a lid. This steams the gyoza in a few minutes. Take out and serve with rice vinegar and soy sauce.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/books/tao-te-ching/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;This translation is beautiful. Ursula&#x27;s prose and poetry are a vessel of unbeknownst resonance for this subject matter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the ideas from the Tao repeat the importance of &lt;em&gt;doing by not doing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I recognize this in my own life, however, at the same time, I cannot help but wonder how this should work together with human qualities that make use more enjoyable in groups, such as initiative, attentiveness, and others. These are all qualities that require something more than mere pacifism. Where does intrinsic motivation come from to do things with others? If we follow the Way (like the Wise Souls, the wind, water..) and not the humane process, how do we ever get around to doing anything? Sure, we do not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to be doing anything, that is one of its key lessons. But still.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that this book is truly a work to be picked up and read again and again. It was powerful to read through it all in one go, but I imagine part of its power is also in providing a constant source of inspiration throughout our days. There is not a single time that is best fit to read the Tao. Every moment is equally fitting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula explicitly states that her work is not a &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but rather a &lt;em&gt;rendition&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I think she could not have done a better job. I found this the most beautiful introduction to the Tao I&#x27;ve read. There were some bits I had learned about its philosophy earlier from reading Alan Watts, but never a full-blown, conscious and focused treating of the matter. This does make me want to read Alan&#x27;s book &lt;em&gt;Tao: The Watercourse Way&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; even more though. His writing is equally beautiful in its simplicity, though in a different way. And I imagine Alan does not write his rendition of the Tao as poetry, which Ursula did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many chapter&#x2F;poems worthy of remembering and reciting. And I am sure there will be many opportunities to do so, for a large variety of them as written by Ursula. Let me just list the last two poems of the book, both of which made a very powerful impression on me (though this might result from a recency bias).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let there be a little country without many people.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and never use them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
let them be mindful of death&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and disinclined to long journeys&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They&#x27;d have ships and carriages,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but no place to go.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They&#x27;d have armor and weapons,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but no parades.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Instead of writing,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they might go back to using knotted cords.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They&#x27;d enjoy eating,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
take pleasure in clothes,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
be happy with their houses,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
devoted to their customs.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The next little country might be so close&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the people could hear cocks crowing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and dogs barking there,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but they&#x27;d get old and die&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
without ever having been there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 80 is titled &lt;em&gt;Freedom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It is a touching little gem of worldbuilding, with romantic longing for simpler, more content lives. Is this what we humans aspire to when we say we seek happiness?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telling it true&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True words aren&#x27;t charming,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
charming words aren&#x27;t true.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Good people aren&#x27;t contentious,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
contentious people aren&#x27;t good.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
People who know aren&#x27;t learned,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
learned people don&#x27;t know.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise souls don&#x27;t hoard;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the more they do for others the more they have,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the more they give the richer they are.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The Way of heaven profits without destroying.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Doing without outdoing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
is the Way of the wise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 81 is titled &lt;em&gt;Telling it true&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It closes the book really well. With elements that have been repeated throughout it; the paradoxically sounding distinctions that are made over two lines. There is the &lt;em&gt;doing without doing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but with a little twist, keeping it fresh all the way until the end. The last two lines of the first stanza actually remind me of a sentence from Ursula&#x27;s short story &lt;em&gt;Mountain ways&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (bundled in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;isbn&#x2F;9780060509064&quot;&gt;The birthday of the world and other stories&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but also published online in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarkesworldmagazine.com&#x2F;le_guin_03_14_reprint&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Clarkesworld&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a scholar of the Discussions, Enno knew more questions than most people, but fewer answers.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This classic story is sublimely epic in scope and you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; this every beautiful section of prose that hints at worlds, cultures, religions, and motives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this grand feeling approach to stories.
Deep dives into (fictional) human cultures are absolutely fascinating to me.
I find that in performing these studies, we actually start to question, investigate, and learn many things about the lives we live and societies we build and sustain.
With his writing in Dune, Frank more than delivers on this goal of storytelling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank describes the desert world and her people imaginatively such that I started feeling this sense of wonder.
Arguably, the ecological and religious are also a large focus of the book.
I did feel that his writing tended towards a certain objective voice, with clean-cut switches between perspectives on wildly different sides of the story spectrum.
This prevents us from getting too attached to any single character, and might instead symbolize the desert planet Arrakis as a character of its own.
Thus the objective voice is in actuality the perspective of Arrakis and her ecosystem, which would indeed be objective relative to any human faction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also makes me long to read Frank&#x27;s descriptions of all the other planets in his universe.
Caladan would make a very interesting place.
With its many waters, it reminds me of the world of Earthsea from Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s writing; a vast archipelago, hundreds of islands, and curious people, looking to do well and live.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also delighted to read the context of the sentence which I quoted in the epigraph of chapter three in my &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;research&quot;&gt;Master&#x27;s thesis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn&#x27;t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: &#x27;A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.&#x27; That seemed to satisfy her.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also seem to appear some Taoist themes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity,&quot; he said. &quot;They say: &#x27;Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.&#x27;&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fremen were supreme in the quality the ancients called &quot;spannungsbogen&quot; — which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the the obvious psychedelic influences in descriptions of Bene Geserit abilities.
At least to me the following descriptions hinted highly at those types of experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed and all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He held himself poised in the awareness, seeing time stretch out in its weird dimension, delicately balanced yet whirling, narrow yet spread like a net gathering countless worlds and forces, a tightwire that he must walk, yet a teeter-totter on which he balanced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving a couple other beautiful phrases here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She put a palm against his cheek, &quot;I&#x27;m no longer afraid, Usul. Look at me. I see what you see when you hold me thus.&quot;
&quot;What do you see?&quot; he demanded.
&quot;I see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It&#x27;s what we were meant to do.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul-Muad&#x27;Dib lay alone in the Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell. And he lay as one dead, caught up in the revelatino of the Water of Life, his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life. Thus was the prophecy made true that the Lisan al-Gaib might be both dead and alive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My brother comes now,&quot; Alia said. &quot;Even an Emperor may tremble before Muad&#x27;Dib, for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Ribollita in my father&#x27;s kitchen in early autumn, Tilburg, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribollita is a Tuscan peasant soup, traditionally &lt;em&gt;reheated&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; from leftover minestrones and other foodstuffs.
Not a glamorous introduction to the rich Italian cuisine, arguably.
I&#x27;ve made Italian lasagna&#x27;s, ragù&#x27;s, fish-, and vegetable-dishes before, but none of those in the context of this project.
So I don&#x27;t want to include them in my notes (mostly because I don&#x27;t have pleasing photos yet; no, but &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; because I just prefer writing my thoughts one-at-a-time in recent-relevant contexts).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sources of course include &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ribollita&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;1016052-ribollita&quot;&gt;NYT Cooking&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but also &lt;em&gt;The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Marcella Hazan (p.113 has a &quot;Tuscan peasant soup with cabbage and beans&quot; called &lt;em&gt;acquacotta&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; it is a bit richer, including eggs, Parmesan cheese, and lemon).
Also read through this nice article on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divinacucina.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;trattoria-marios-ribollita&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Trattoria Mario&#x27;s ribollita&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the cute &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;divinacucina.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Divina Cucina&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Now there is also a recipe from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nonnabox.com&#x2F;ribollita&#x2F;&quot;&gt;NonnaBox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making this from scratch, I slightly nullified the meaning of this dish (it being reheated leftovers), but I made sure to prepare plenty of soup so that my father would be able to eat it on days dotted throughout the week, thereby redeeming the meaning a little.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by sautéeing a sofrito of onion, carrot, and celery with salt.
When properly softened, throw in aromatics: garlic and tomato paste and sear their edge off.
Pour in a can of crushed tomatoes and enough vegetable broth to cover.
Add a bouquet of rosemary and thyme to the pot.
Put in a good bunch of chopped kale leaves, possibly first stirring it through so that everything slinks a bit, before adding more.
Aim for roughly one-hundred grams of kale per person.
I added some cubed stale bread (the same as I&#x27;ll be describing further down) to the soup here, to bulk it out while soaking and softening.
Cover and let it simmer for as many hours as you reasonably want to wait, replenishing water when necessary.
A couple of tens of minutes before serving, include cannellini beans and stir them through.
Check for seasoning, extending the dish with salt and black pepper where necessary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recipes stress the importance of good Tuscan (unsalted) bread, or at least something that gets you excited when crunching, cutting, and biting into.
In my father&#x27;s hometown there is an amazing sourdough bakery that bakes the most delicious breads with amazingly flavorful slightly-burned crusts.
We got some bread from there.
Aim for something like this.
I find that great bread brings a disproportionately high amount of life satisfaction.
Might be something personal.
Don&#x27;t bother with pulling a faux-onion-soupy move by putting slices of bread in your serving bowls, covering it with cheese, and grilling it in an oven for a few minutes.
Grate good chase over your servings instead, and serve with the bread on the side.
Might sprinkle with fresh herbs to your liking as garnish.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bagna-cauda&quot;&gt;Bagna càuda&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made this Piedmontese fondue-like dish from garlic and anchovies for Christmas with my family, as one of the appetizers. Served it with plenty of fresh vegetables. I am ashamed to say that we used heavy cream in our preparation of the dish. To refrain from offending any Italians, just use butter and olive oil as your sources of fat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bagna_c%C3%A0uda&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.co.il&#x2F;books?id=Gk7OAgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA16&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Risotto with mushrooms, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the classic comfort dish. I used to have a period of time in which Max and I would regularly prepare different risottos, and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VOBihHeZuXE&quot;&gt;watch Gennaro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; be his extravagant Italian self. Amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform a quick mise en place:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch some arborio rice&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dice some onion&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a nice broth to simmer next to your risotto pan on the stove&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get enough butter (really, you can never have enough butter for risotto)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy some good white wine (shaoxing does actually also work to a satisfying degree)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parmesan cheese (I either use grana padano or parmigiano reggiano, or both)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare some ingredients to pimp your risotto&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pimping of a risotto must be a conscious act. Conscious in the sense that you do not want to over-pimp. Just like with much of the Italian cuisine, less is more. Some good pimps are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mix of mushrooms&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pumpkin&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asparagus (green, naturally, the only type Italians consider worthy, according to Marcella Hazan in her small book on ingredients)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or, a natural bianco&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, sweat onions in butter and olive oil. Then throw in your arborio rice naked. Stir a few minutes until the starch layer has fried off. Pour in your cooking wine and let the alcohol evaporate. Now the fun starts. We are going to be continuously stirring our risotto on low heat, ladling in hot broth from time to time (only a couple of spoonfuls). Continue until the rice is just done; nice and soft, no hard starchy kernel when you bite into it. We have added our pimps somewhere along this journey, depending on their specific cooking time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish the risotto, grate in an unhealthy dose of parmesan, and add in another block of butter. Put a lid on the pan, take it off the heat, and let sit for ten minutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To serve, ladle on a plate and shake it to all sides, spreading it out. Garnish with some fresh parsley.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fresh-pasta&quot;&gt;Fresh pasta&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Fresh pasta with a simple tomato-basil sauce, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are basically two methods of making fresh pasta: by hand, or by machine. I&#x27;ve done both before, but as I do not actually own a pasta machine myself, my most recent pastas were stretched by hand using a rolling pin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly base the recipe and procedure on Marcella Hazan&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. But because the stretching procedure is quite complicated, I looked up an Italian nonna that demonstrates it on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uuY3yZkaLWI&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either go for egged pasta dough (115g flour to 2 eggs, for roughly 3 portions), or vegan pasta dough (1:1 flour water + some oil). You can use either wheat flour or durum wheat. Apparently those are used predominantly in Northern Italy and Southern Italy respectively. I finally learned that semolina is actually &quot;griesmeel&quot; in Dutch. For some reason I had never connected griesmeel to pasta.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix and knead. Kneading is done by pushing the dough away with the palm of your hand and then folding the mass back over itself, turning it, and repeating the whole operation. Continue until the dough is as smooth as baby skin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the time to stretch the pasta dough. The rolling pin is narrower and longer than pastry pins. Make sure that your dough is properly rested (i.e., its gluten are relaxed) such that stretching it becomes easier; fifteen minutes to two hours. Here I refer to the video I linked above. When I made this together with Noemi, she was spinning the dough around and stretching it over the edge of the table; kind of like you would with a pizza dough, that is, if you&#x27;re either a pro or self-confident enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cut tagliatelle by hand. First repeatedly fold the thin pasta dough onto itself until you have a flat roll of about seven-and-a-half centimeters in width, dusting the layers inbetween with flour. Cut the roll into ribbons of about six millimeters wide. Roll them into nests and dust with more flour if necessary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook al dente in a few minutes in heavily salted water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Focaccia with rosemary and olives, fresh out of the oven at my mother&#x27;s kitchen in Tilburg, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend to watch Samin Nosrat&#x27;s mini-documentary &lt;em&gt;Salt Fat Acid Heat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on Netflix. She makes focaccia in the first episode; &lt;em&gt;Fat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This luxuriously tasting bread is actually quite easy. For a 7g packet of dry yeast, use 500g flour and 67% water. First dissolve the yeast in 100ml lukewarm water for ten minutes. Combine all ingredients and add two tablespoons of olive oil and 3-5% salt. Mix until the dough is manageable and soft, but not too sticky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slap and stretch the dough, fold back and press with the palm of your hand. Work it for ten minutes, before you pat it into a round shape. Leave it to rest for fifteen minutes. Then spread out the dough in an oiled baking sheet and push it to the edges with your fingers. Drizzle over more olive oil and spread it out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now press your fingers into the dough to form the focaccia&#x27;s characteristic holes. Pour over a &lt;em&gt;brine&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of olive oil, water and salt. Spread out rosemary sprigs. Leave it to rest for another thirty minutes. This helps the holes to stay in the focaccia after baking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bake at 230 degrees celsius until it is done. Serve with more olive oil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Fresh green pesto, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight back from Sardinia and I brought enough fresh produce to make pesto.
Start with garlic and pine nuts (mortar-and-pestling garlic is extremely satisfying by the way).
Slowly introduce basil leaves and some coarse salt.
Add your Italian hard cheese (traditionally a mix of Reggiano and Pecorino, but I only had a Grana Padano on hand).
Drizzle in some olive oil to help everything incorporate.
When transfering to a jar, cover with more olive oil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cooked up some pasta that we brought from Italy and whipped everything up into a simple but deliciously creamy totality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This novella is an amazingly humane glance at what science fiction &lt;em&gt;also&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has to offer.
It blesses the reader with hope, inspiration, and empathy for human exploration of space and the big Why.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the way Becky breathes life into the three scientists and the space engineer Ariadne in their journey commissioned by the citizen-cooperative space program known as OCA.
She is exceptionally good in crafting relatable characters, with wholesome and feel-good souls.
I knew this already from reading her book &lt;em&gt;The long way to a small, angry planet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; last year, for which many people also laud the characters.
Where that book was much about learning the different cultures and species from all corners of the galaxy through its characters, &lt;em&gt;To be taught, if fortunate&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; explores humanity through the ethically idealistic version of science, in a fourth-wall-breaking appeal to the reader.
It asks us questions of Why.
It stops to meditate on where our human curiosity could, and should, take us.
And all of this while wholesomely interrogating human emotions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a great novella to read on an afternoon, to rekindle sparks of hope and inspiration in Us as a species, though be it a fictional humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This is a nice little short story, in which we experience the ethical transformation of the ruthless general Daynja Édo who is employed by the Boorhian Empire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like my reading of this was too scattered around in time to fully appreciate it.
Please do read this in one sitting, for the sake of your own enjoyment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.D. Lewis shows us how to quickly and efficiently worldbuild enough in this short story for it to feel believably fantastical; really well done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, and this is more my personal shortcoming, I think I did not have enough time to truly get into the story and the world, which is something I experience more often with short stories and flash fiction.
In a way, this might also be a non-goal of such shorter pieces.
Instead, they often focus on ideas, concepts, parts of a world, or a short character exploration.
Sometimes with a message, othertimes to hit one emotional snare really powerfully.
This diversity in goals and the focus the medium lends the pursuement of them is what gives short fiction its powerful potential, and, sometimes, delivers masterful gems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book isn&#x27;t one of the gems, but it sure is a good nugget of well-crafted imaginative practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cosmic game of hide and seek&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; a brilliant introduction to parts of human philosophy grossly under-represented in Western society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book — which is a written account of some six lectures orated by Alan — is truly magnificent.
It treats large ontological questions head-on from fascinating philosophical perspectives (Hinduism, Buddhish, and Zen) while simultaneously criticizing Western religious thinking.
Alan has a likable wit in his words that make you so enormously excited to know more and to breathe a pleasant peace and joy in life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this book I annotated disproportionately many phrases and paragraphs, considering its modest page count.
There is just too much beautiful brilliance in here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-i-the-nature-of-consciousness&quot;&gt;Part I: The nature of consciousness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any good scientist knows that what you call the external world is as much you as your own body.
Your skin doesn&#x27;t actually separate you from the world — it&#x27;s a bridge through which the world flows into you, and you flow into the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myths underlying our culture and underlying our common sense have not taught us to feel identical with the universe.
And that&#x27;s why we feel alien to it, as if we were separate parts confronting the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] that&#x27;s the whole nature of God. To play that he&#x27;s not God.
God abandons himself — he gives himself away and gets lost.
In this way, everybody is the fundamental reality — not God in a politically kingly sense, but God in the sense of being the self.
Deep down, you&#x27;re all this basic reality, but you&#x27;re pretending that you&#x27;re not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body is continuous with the total energy system of the cosmos.
It&#x27;s all you. But you&#x27;re playing the game that you&#x27;re this tiny, little bit of everything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet we persist with our little, partial view: &quot;No, I&#x27;m just something in this body. I&#x27;m just this ego.&quot;
What a joke. The ego is nothing other than the focus of conscious attention.
It&#x27;s like radar on a ship — it&#x27;s a troubleshooter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#x27;t give up desire. It&#x27;s like telling someone to be unselfish or get rid of their ego or let go and relax.
Why would you want to do all that? Only because you&#x27;re trying to beat the game.
Because you&#x27;re still operating under the hypothesis that you are different from the universe, so you want to get one up on it.
And competing with the universe just reveals that you don&#x27;t understand that you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the universe.
You still think there&#x27;s a real different between self and other, but the two are mutually necessary, just like the poles on a magnet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] gurus of all types tell you to know yourself, to look within, to find out who you really are,
because the harder you look, the less you will find, and then you&#x27;ll realize it was never there in the first place.
There isn&#x27;t a separate you. Your mind is what there is. It&#x27;s everything. But the only way to find that out is to delve into the state of delusions as hard as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-ii-the-web-of-life&quot;&gt;Part II: The web of life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&#x27;re perfectly honest about loving yourself and don&#x27;t pull any punches and don&#x27;t pretend that you&#x27;re anything other than exactly what you are,
you suddenly come to discover that the self you love is the universe. You don&#x27;t like all of it —
you&#x27;re still highly selective — but on the whole, you love yourself in terms of what is other.
Because it&#x27;s only in terms of what is other that you have a self at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the more you are engaged with the external world, the more you are enriched.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-iii-inevitable-ecstasy&quot;&gt;Part III: Inevitable ecstasy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we die is to give us the opportunity to understand what life is all about,
and we can only experience that when we let go, because it is only then that we come to a situation that the ego can&#x27;t deal with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meditative consciousness, you will see that nothing is more important than anything else.
And there is no such thing as wasting time, because what is time for except to be wasted?
Just sit and do nothing. Meditation is the perfect waste of time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-iv-the-world-as-just-so&quot;&gt;Part IV: The world as just so&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] bodhi in Sanskrit alludes to awakening from the illusion of being a separate ego locked up in a bag of skin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] simply because they are attached to punctuality as a fetish.
We spend an awful lot of energy trying to make our lives fit images of what life is or should be —
images which our lives could never possibly match or fit.
So Zen practice entails getting rid of those images.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first begin zazen — that is, sitting meditation — you don&#x27;t do much other than count your breathing,
maybe by tens, until your thoughts become more still.
And Zen people don&#x27;t close their eyes when they meditate, nor do they close their ears.
They keep their eyes on the floor in front of them, and they don&#x27;t try to force away any sounds that are going on
or any smells or any other sensations whatsoever.
They don&#x27;t block any of that out.
And as time goes on, they spend less time counting their breath and more time devoted to the koan assigned to them by the roshi —
What is the sound of one hand clapping?
Who were you before your father and mother conceived you?
Does a dog have Buddha Nature?
That sort of thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this all takes differing periods of time.
For some people, it only takes ten years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-v-the-world-as-self&quot;&gt;Part V: The world as self&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] moksha — liberation.
Liberation from the hallucination that you are just some poor little me.
It means to wake up from that kind of hypnosis and discover that you are something being done by this vast,
incredible self that has no beginning, no end, neither continuation nor discontinuation —
it&#x27;s beyond all categorization whatsoever.
As the Upanishads say, &quot;It is not this, it is not that.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a famous Zen koan:
&quot;Before your father and mother conceived you, what was your original nature?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans in particular are terrible at this.
Everything you do is done for some serious reason — it&#x27;s the Protestant conscience.
But play is that which is done just for itself — for fun.
And the self — atman, Brahman — exists for fun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to work to survive, because you think you have to survive.
But you don&#x27;t have to. And this whole thing doesn&#x27;t have to go on, which is why it does.
I know that seems paradoxical, but think about it — life is full of examples of this.
If I try to impress someone, I usually don&#x27;t.
If you try to too hard with anything, you usually make a mess of it.
So the one self behind the world is engaged in play, which is why it is said that Brahman does not actually &lt;em&gt;become&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the world —
Brahman &lt;em&gt;plays&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at being the world, which is distinct from &lt;em&gt;working at it&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does any group of people like to do when they don&#x27;t have to do anything?
As far as I can tell, people get together and do something rhythmic — they dance, sing, and play games.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forget that trough implies crest, and crest implies trough.
There is no such thing as pure sound — sound is sound&#x2F;silence.
Light is light&#x2F;darkness.
Light is pulsation — between every light pulse there is the dark pulse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are Egyptian inscriptions from 6000 BCE or so that describe the world as going hopelessly to the dogs.
It seems this has always been the complaint.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] things get worse and worse as time goes on until the end of the kali yuga when Shiva puts on a black appearance
with ten arms and dances a dance called the tandava, in which the whole universe is destroyed in fire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this involves certain ideas that are quite alien to the West.
To begin with, the idea of the world as play.
Our Lord God in the West tends to be overserious, and none of the famous Christian artists every painted Christ laughing or smiling.
He&#x27;s always this tragic figure who has this sort of look in his eye that says,
&quot;One of these days, you and I have to get together for a very serious talk.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the guru&#x27;s job is to show the inquirer in some effective way that they are already what they are looking for.
In Hindu traditions, realizing who you really are is called &lt;em&gt;sadhana&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which means &quot;discipline.&quot;
Sadhana is the way of life that is necessary to follow in order to escape from the illusion that you are merely a skin-encapsulated ego.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] we are brought up in a social scheme that tells us we have to deserve what we get,
and the price to pay for all good things is suffering.
But all that is mere postponement.
We are afraid here and now to see the truth.
And if we had the nerve — you know, real nerve — we&#x27;d see it right away.
But that&#x27;s when we immediately feel that we shouldn&#x27;t have nerve like that, because it would be awful.
After all, we&#x27;re supposed to feel like a poor little me who has to work and work and suffer in order to become something far away and great,
like a Buddha or &lt;em&gt;jivanmukta&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; — someone who becomes liberated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;samadhi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; — the attainment of nondualistic consciousness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;vanaprastha&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; — the person in Hindu society who has played the social game their entire life and now devotes themselves to self-discovery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-vi-the-world-as-emptiness&quot;&gt;Part VI: The world as emptiness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the Buddha proposed the Four Noble Truths: dukkha, trishna, nirvana, and marga.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese word &lt;em&gt;yugen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; refers to subtle profundity, but it&#x27;s also a way of digging change.
It&#x27;s described poetically — you feel yugen when you see, out in the distance, some ships hidden behind a far-off island.
You feel yugen when you watch wild geese fly, then suddenly disappear in the clouds.
You feel yugen when you look across at a mountain you&#x27;ve never been to before, and you see the sky on the other side.
You don&#x27;t go over there to look and see what&#x27;s on the other side — that wouldn&#x27;t be yugen.
You let the other side be the other side, and it invokes something in your imagination, but you don&#x27;t attempt to define it or pin it down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things vanish into the mystery. And if you try to pursue them, you destroy yugen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are liberated by the very fact of not being able to stop changing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death isn&#x27;t terrible — it&#x27;s just going to be the end of you as a system of memories.
So you&#x27;ve got a great chance right before it happens to let go of everything,
because you know it&#x27;s all going to go, and knowing that will help you let go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialectic method is perfectly simple and can be done with an individual student and teacher
or with a group — you&#x27;d be amazed at how effective it is when it involves precious little more than discussion.
The teacher gradually elicits from participants their basic premises on life — what their fundamental assumptions are.
What is right and wrong?
What is the good life?
Where do you take your stand?
And the teacher finds this out for each student and then demolishes it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagarjuna continued on to teach that you must &quot;void the void&quot; — that is, you mustn&#x27;t cling to the void.
And so the void of nonvoid is the great state, as it were, of Nagarjuna&#x27;s Buddhism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It is actually a concrete story and not just this daunting monument of classic science fiction that I had envisioned in my mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after finishing this book did I realize that my expectations for it were influenced by my experience with works from Asimov.
And apparently, this man is known for his gloriously emotionally dim books; basically using the concept of a novel to instead push forth his academic-style playthings.
But Philip writes very engagingly and in a well-paced manner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I ultimately still found the story and plot to be lacking in depth.
Though it was good, it did not reach a point of highly captivating quality for me.
In contrast, the mood or atmosphere put forth in the book is mostly what makes it interesting.
This aspect of the work is also most aptly captured in the films it inspired, where it arguably works even more effectively.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story left me with feelings of slight despair and emptiness; which I see as a feature, a conscious effect intended by the writer.
For the kind of story Philip tells, I think he quite professionally massages you into its emotional state.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having realized the diversity of classic science fiction, I now intend to read many more such works.
From the many great bookshops in Amsterdam I already gathered a small trove of paper treasures: Joe Haldeman, Octavia E. Butler, Ian Banks, William Gibson, Ursula K. Le Guin, Fritz Leiber.
And on my list I also wrote others: Peter Hamilton, Dan Simmons, Arthur C. Clarke, Orson Scott Card, Kurt Vonnegut.
Now, I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; need to read more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>The difficulty of categorizing cuisines by country</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/how-to-categorize-cuisines/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;After starting my personal challenge of cooking meals from every country in the world, I started realizing that splitting up cuisines by country sometimes misses out on some larger and more meaningful patterns.
An example would be &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Levantine_cuisine&quot;&gt;Levantine cuisine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The Levant is a historical geographical pointer to countries in the Eastern Mediterranean part of Western Asia; Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, parts of Turkey, sometimes stretching to include parts of Egypt and Libya.
An important common denominator of their respective cuisines is meze, with dishes including tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ghanoush.
I cooked ful medames once and put it under my Palestine tab, but it is actually cooked across the region, including Egypt, with which I found it first associated.
And there are many more such examples!
So instead, I think I should make an effort to classify cuisines on a more content-aware basis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some very interesting Wikipedia articles related to food, cuisines, and history.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timeline_of_food&quot;&gt;timeline of foods&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, listing when certain ingredients came into existence in certain places&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_historical_cuisines&quot;&gt;list of historical cuisines&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which includes Aztec, Maya, Inca, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, and many more cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_cuisines&quot;&gt;list of cuisines&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in which the templates at the bottom contain more information than the actual article&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikibooks.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cookbook:Table_of_Contents&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Cookbook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia cookbook nicely groups cuisines by region in the following ten categories.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;African cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Asian cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediterranean cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle Eastern cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North American cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pacific cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South American cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Asian cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southeast Asian cuisines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this categorization seems to lack a place for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Asian_cuisines#Central_Asian_cuisine&quot;&gt;Central Asian cuisines&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; including Kazakh, Tajik, Uzbek, and others.
Furthermore, though Mediterranean is quite a distinct style, it feels superfluous in my categorization.
Might be better to replace it with Central Asian instead, thereby covering practically every part of the world in our ten regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This book delivers a satisfying story in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world with imaginative worldbuilding, but nothing blazing-your-pants-off epic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading and enjoying the Murderbot Diaries (see my thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;fugitive-telemetry&quot;&gt;Fugitive telemetry&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) I decided to read some of Martha Wells&#x27;s other work.
&lt;em&gt;City of bones&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a standalone fantasy novel from 1995.
I realized it had actually been some time since I read proper fantasy, as recently I rather prefer to read sci-fi instead.
It felt great to submerge myself into a fantasy world again though.
The book&#x27;s standalone nature also lowered the barrier of entry, because I didn&#x27;t feel like I was committing to a gargantuan universe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere mid-way I found myself writing down some reflections on the book.
I felt like the character motivations of Khat and Sagai didn&#x27;t really convince me.
They are continuously risking their lives (and their family&#x27;s) to steal ancient relics, without any prospect of adequate reward.
One argument that seems to be the linchpin, is that they both like Elen the Warder, but to me that just signals that these characters are too morally perfect.
It causes the sensation of a lack of depth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the final climax of the novel, which was delicately crafted and satisfyingly paced.
It strokes with what others wrote online, that the book can feel a little slow-burning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think N.K. Jemisin&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;show&#x2F;376629746&quot;&gt;review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Goodreads (Jemisin wrote the beautiful &lt;em&gt;The broken earth&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; trilogy) quite aptly captures what makes this novel interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[a] clever-yet-hapless , fish-out-of-the-water protagonist&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;breathtaking sense of beauty and almost primordial danger in every landscape&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also notes how the story at some point turns Lovecraftian, referring to the &lt;em&gt;Inhabitants of the West&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Drawing from the definition on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lovecraftian_horror&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;[emphasizing] the horror of the unknowable and incomprehensible&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; — I think it fits especially well as a description of how I enjoyed that aspect of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Books of the Raksura&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are hailed as an even better execution of themes that already appear in &lt;em&gt;City of bones&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Based on this online consensus, I recommend reading both.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Together with my friend Feri from Iran, I&#x27;ve been cooking a few Persian dishes while still in Finland.
We made a small feast of rice with two different khoresh dishes (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Khoresh&quot;&gt;Persian term for stews&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
Of course, it was way too much food for two people, just like a traditional Persian meal should be.
Feri told me that her mother would be disappointed when they would finish all the food, because it is seen as a sign that she did not cook enough.
Alas, no calorie counting today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note on the difference between Persian and Iranian.
While talking to Feri, I noticed that she consistently used &lt;em&gt;Persian&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to describe the language and many other cultural traditions.
I asked her where &lt;em&gt;Farsi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; fits in then, to which she answered that Farsi would indeed be more specific and correct.
Invoking Persia gives grand connotations of historical Iranian empires in the geographical area of the Persian gulf.
According to Wikipedia&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Farsi_(disambiguation)&quot;&gt;disambiguation page for Farsi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Farsi is the indigenous name for Persian.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feri also wrote the recipes in Farsi for me, so that I could include them here. Thanks Feri!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Persian rice with tahdig, served in the afterglow of a summer day, outside my apartment in Otaniemi, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice is ubiquitous in Persian cuisine.
The &lt;em&gt;tahdig&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a specialty from Iran, referring to a crust on the bottom of the pot.
Though a tahdig can also be achieved with bread, potato and vegetables, in this dish aim for a crisp and caramelized layer of rice.
People fight over the last pieces of tahdig.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by adding rice to a pot and pouring in water until there is a layer of two centimeters on top.
We splurged a bit and already added saffron at this stage, together with some salt and olive oil.
Cook without a lid on medium heat until the rice is tender, but with body left; basically as soon as there is no hard starchy core anymore when biting into it.
Drain the rice (with apologies to all East-Asian people).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infuse some saffron in cooking water for ten minutes.
Mix a good chunk of butter with a few spoons of yogurt, the brewed saffron, and some rice.
Spread this into a layer on the bottom of the pot.
Pour the remaining rice back on top.
Cover with a clean towel underneath the lid to keep the steam inside and cook for forty-five to ninety minutes, depending on your heat (medium to medium-low).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a garnish: in a separate pan, toast dried barberries, sliced pistachios, and almonds.
After a minute or two, add some of the infused saffron and a couple of spoons of rice.
Stir until the water is evaporated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the rice is done, turn it around on a plate and drape the garnish in a ring surrounding it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‎برنج را توی قابلمه بریزید و روی آن آب بریزید به اندازه ای که حدود ۲ سانتی‌متر بالاتر از سطح برنج ها آب باشد. کمی روغن، نمک، زعفران اضافه کنید. اجازه دهید تا روی حرارت متوسط بپزد. وقتی برنجها نرم شدند آنها را آبکش‌ کنید.
‎سپس ۱۰۰ گرم کره، ۳-۴ قاشق ماست، کمی زعفران و کمی برنج را مخلوط کرده و کف قابلمه بریزید و پخش کنید. بعد بقیه ی برنجها را روی آن بریزید و بگذارید دم بکشد.
‎برای تهدیگ مناسب باید ۴۵ دقیقه روی درجه ۳&#x2F;۶ یا ۱ ساعت و نیم روی درجه ۲&#x2F;۶ حرارت ببیند.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎برای تزیین، کمی زرشک را تفت دهید، سپس زعفران دم شده، کمی برنج، خلال پسته و خلال بادام را اضافه کنید و تفت دهید&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Northern Iranian baghali ghatogh with lima beans, dill, and eggs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delicious, vegetarian khoresh from northern Iran (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baghali_ghatogh&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gAd_oVmts64&quot;&gt;Traditionally&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, baghali ghatogh should use arikara beans, soaked overnight.
We couldn&#x27;t find these in Finland, so we used lima beans instead.
This dish is spiced with garlic and turmeric.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fry very finely minced garlic in a good chunk of butter.
Add your beans and cook them for a few minutes while stirring.
Now we include a whole bunch of fresh dill (and even some dried dill if you fancy), turmeric, black pepper, and salt.
Infuse the spices for a moment, before adding water.
Let this cook on low heat for an hour, adjusting the level of liquid while stirring from time to time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could poach some eggs in the stew near the end, but instead we stirred through the eggs and covered the pan with a lid.
This gave it a slightly different texture that Feri prefers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve and garnish with fresh dill.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;باقالی قاتق&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;لوبیای کشاورزی را ۱۲ ساعت در آب بگذارید تا خیس بخورد. بعد از ۱۲ ساعت پوست لوبیا ها را بکنید .
۵ حبه سیر راخرد کرده و ۳۰ ثانیه با ۱۰۰ گرم کره تفت دهید.
سپس لوبیا ها رو اضافه کنید و تفت دهید.
شوید تازه، زردچوبه (۱ قاشق غذاخوری)، نمک، فلفل و شوید خشک (۳ قاشق غذاخوری)
را اضافه کنید و چند دقیقه هم بزنید تا عطر ادویه ها به مشام برسد.
حرارت را کم کنید، ۲ لیوان آب را اضافه کنید و اجازه دهید با حرارت کم بپزد.
(در آخر میتوانید کمی شوید تازه مجددا اضافه کنید).
تخم‌مرغ را اضافه کنید و بگذارید بپزد.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Khoresh karafs but with halloumi cheese instead of meat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently a rather quick khoresh, with celery (karafs).
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fcWUZJErZAA&quot;&gt;Normally&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (or see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;1021434-khoresh-karafs-persian-celery-stew-with-lamb&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) this would be prepared with lamb or beef meat, but we kept it vegetarian with a grilled halloumi cheese.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chop celery stems in pieces of roughly three centimeters in size.
Collect the celery leaves, chop them, and save them for later.
Chop a similar amount of parsley, and half that amount of mint leaves.
Mince an onion and fry it off in some olive oil.
Season with turmeric, pepper, and salt.
Add in the grilled halloumi, chopped in pieces, then throw in the celery and stir.
Now include all of our herbs and stir for a minute.
Pour in some water and simmer the khoresh until celery has softened to your personal preference.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;خورش کرفس&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;پنیر هالومی را گریل کنید و وقتی سرد شد به تکه های کوچک ۳ سانتی‌متری تقسیم‌کنید.
ساقه کرفس را‌ به تکه های ۳ سانتی‌متری خرد کنید.
برگ های کرفس را خرد کنید. به همان‌میزان یا مقداری بیشتر جعفری تازه خرد کنید. چند برگ نعناع (کمتر از نصف مقدار جعفری ها) خرد کنید.
یک پیاز خرد کرده و با روغن تفت دهید. سپس ادویه (نمک، فلفل و زردچوبه) اضافه‌کنید. میتوانید مقداری آب اضافه کنید تا پیاز ها نسوزند. سپس تکه های پنیر را اضافه کنید.
تکه های کرفس را اضافه کرده و کمی تفت دهید. سپس سبزیهای خرد شده را اضافه کنید و کمی تفت دهید.
سپس کمی آب اضافه کنید و بگذارید تا مواد بپزندتا وقتی کرفسها به انذازه ی مطلوب نرم شده باشند.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Kuku sabzi, a Persian herb frittata, in my mother&#x27;s kitchen, Tilburg, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Persian herb frittata known as &lt;em&gt;kuku sabzi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; seems to be a widely-celebrated piece of Persian cuisine.
It uses a large bunch of fresh herbs and some eggs to make a delicious center piece for a vegetarian meal.
I was recently listening to episodes of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernpersianfood.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Modern Persian Food&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; podcast in which this dish is also mentioned (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernpersianfood.com&#x2F;episode-28&#x2F;&quot;&gt;episode 28&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
But more importantly, I ran across some articles written by my favorite Samin Nosrat for the New York Times.
She writes about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;1020203-kuku-sabzi-persian-herb-frittata&quot;&gt;kuku sabzi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as part of her series on essential Persian recipes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My version of this dish is practically the same as Samin&#x27;s.
I served it with freshly baked pita bread, mast-o khiar (see below), radishes, and feta cheese with olive oil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Samin mentions that the crust should be almost black, I found that most pictures online seem to go a little bit easier on the darkness compared to what my kuku sabzi resulted in.
Nonetheless, the midnight-black crust tasted rather sweet and not at all pungently burnt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mast-o khiar is a beautiful, yogurt-based side dish in Persian cuisine.
When making it, the thicker the yogurt the better.
Preferably use &lt;em&gt;labneh&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is strained yogurt, thus with most of its whey removed, resulting in a thicker consistency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Dutch supermarkets haven&#x27;t heard of labneh yet, I quickly made my own approximation by straining fatty Greek yogurt in a mesh lined with coffee filters.
Place it over a bowl in the fridge for some hours before it is ready to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drew mostly from Samin Nosrat&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;1020213-mast-o-khiar-persian-cucumber-and-herb-yogurt&quot;&gt;recipe for the New York Times&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Add diced cucumber (less watery than grated), raisins (plumped up by soaking in water beforehand), yogurt, fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, dill), garlic, salt, and black pepper to a nice bowl.
Stir in some walnuts, roughly chopped, right before serving.
Works amazingly with many dishes, or just with some good flatbread on its own already.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Khask-e bademjan topped with walnuts and caramelized onions, served with lavash, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing about kashk-e bademjan from some Iranian&#x2F;American podcasts, in addition to Feri and Navid telling me about this dish.
Naturally, because it is a good recommendation for people who prefer to eat no meat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dish basically consists of aubergine and &lt;em&gt;kashk&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Kashk is a by-product of making cheese, not the whey but rather &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ns3mb2fXzbQ&quot;&gt;the curds after cooking&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
(There is also &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZroOJLlCWHA&quot;&gt;this amazing little video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on making dried kashk balls.)
It is actually not that difficult to make this myself, so I want to do that soon-ish too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I referenced &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kashk_bademjan&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a recipe by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160324183212&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;persianmama.com&#x2F;eggplant-and-walnut-dip-kashke-bedemjan&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Persian Mama&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=b9atZeRCESE&quot;&gt;Iranian woman on YouTube&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare the aubergines by salting them and letting them sit for a while (fifteen to thirty minutes).
Pat them dry and then sauté them in a sizable gluck of sufficiently hot fat.
In a separate pan, slowly sauté and caramelize grated onion.
Once the aubergines are fried and soft, start mashing them.
Add in the most of the onion, stir in crushed walnuts, turmeric powder, dried mint, and black pepper.
Pour in the kashk (if the kashk was dried, first have it rehydrated and brought up to a boil).
Loosen it up with some more water if necessary.
Let this whole mixture simmer for a few minutes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve on a nice platter, with the remaining onions on top, garnished with roughly crushed walnuts.
Eat with some good bread; I had a fresh lavash from a Turkish supermarket.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Murderbot Diaries has become my most beloved series in recent years.
This sixth entry lives up to the level of comfort reads I&#x27;ve come to expect of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is something about the atmosphere painted by Martha in her series of novellas — with quick, punchy and informal strokes of words — that grips me.
Most of the Murderbot stories contain elements of mystery, but this one dabbled more in the detective genre than others.
I&#x27;ve always loved detective tales; regularly re-reading Sherlock Holmes stories, among others.
Stuff gets even better when these are combined with the fascinating post space colonization future of Martha&#x27;s Murderbot universe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dystopian Corporation Rim was explored in many earlier stories — cut-throat companies with profit motives that push them towards &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ABoringDystopia&#x2F;&quot;&gt;A Boring Dystopia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;- and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LateStageCapitalism&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Late Stage Capitalism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;-esque vibes.
&lt;em&gt;Fugitive telemetry&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; takes place entirely in the Preservation system.
No corporate thugs, but plenty of ignorance concerning the universe and its rough sides.
Otherwise, the Preservation system takes care of its citizens in a worthy way, even going so far as to recognize rights of bots.
Though our friend Murderbot is a special case no one had considered before; a part-bot part-human construct.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not as much entertainment series binging, because it seems like Murderbot actually starts to develop a small passion for helping out its humans.
They rather enjoy their position as independent security consultant, and coming along for the ride remains a splendid adventure.
This book, but really the whole series, is an instant recommendation I would give to anyone I know.
I am looking forward to the next entries in the series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>The conquest of happiness</title>
        <published>2021-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</published>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/books/conquest-of-happiness/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Bertrand&#x27;s position on happiness reads straightforwardly, but it actually takes quite some introspection to formulate it as such.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not really enjoy reading this book; experienced it as a slog.
The texts feel hard to get through, with lots of fluff for what ultimately feels like a straightforward idea or concept.
However, those ideas &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; really fundamental and helpful to fully grasp.
Though the texts are about a hundred years old, which I subjectively experience as quite a long time, many of the struggles seem to hold up significantly well in this day and age.
Then again, texts such as Aurelius&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Meditations&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are a factor of ten times older but those also hold up pretty well.
This might be the survivorship bias&#x27;s influence.
Anyway, the book is available online at the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;in.ernet.dli.2015.222834&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertrand splits up his book in two parts: 1) causes of unhappiness, and 2) causes of happiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unhappiness&quot;&gt;Unhappiness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspects of unhappiness Bertrand discusses are the following.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boredom and excitement&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Envy&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sense of sin&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persecution mania&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of public opinion&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#x27;t be giving a comprehensive survey of his extended opinion on all of them.
Let me just reference some highlights I made along the way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this unhappiness to be very largely due to mistaken views of the world, mistaken ethics, mistaken habits of life, leading to destruction of that natural zest and appetite for possible things upon which all happiness, whether of men or animals, ultimately depends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man may feel so completely thwarted that he seeks no form of satisfaction, ut only distraction and oblivion.
He then becomes a devotee of &quot;pleasure.&quot; That is to say, &lt;strong&gt;he seeks to make life bearable by becoming less alive.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I lived forever the joys of life would inevitably in the end lose their savor. As it is, they remain perennially fresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Competition&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two motives for reading a book: one, that you enjoy it; the other, that you can boast about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Fatigue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great many worries can be diminished by realizing the unimportance of the matter which is causing the anxiety.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Fear of public opinion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the advantages of aristocracy, since where status depended upon birth behavior was allowed to be erratic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;happiness&quot;&gt;Happiness&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspects of happiness Bertrand discusses are as follows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zest&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affection&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The family&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonal interests&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effort and resignation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a mix of qualities that may motivate happiness, and discussions on what happiness means in certain personal situations.
I will again just jot down some quotes I highlighted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Affection&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] general self-confidence towards life comes more than anything else from being accustomed to receive as much of the right sort of affection as one has need for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a higgledy-piggledy place, containing things pleasant and things unpleasant in haphazard sequence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the best kind of affection a man hopes for a new happiness rather than for escape from an old unhappiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caution is enjoined both in the name of morality and in the name of worldly wisdom, with the result that generosity and adventurousness are discouraged where the affections are concerned.
All this tends to produce timidity and anger against mankind, since many people miss throughout life what is really a fundamental need and to nine out of ten an indispensable condition of a happy and expansive attitude towards the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps most fatal to true happiness.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;The family&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] how can all these exquisite and ingenious weapons of destruction function adequately unless there are sufficient populations left for them to destroy?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] nothing causes so much worry in a child&#x27;s mind as lack of certainty and self-confidence on the part of an adult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the mother, if she is not unusually saintly, will expect from her child compensations exceeding those she has a right to expect.
The mother who is conventionally called self-sacrificing is, in a great majority of cases, exceptionally selfish towards her children, for important as parenthood is as an element of life, it is not satisfying if it is treated as the whole of life, and the unsatisfied parent is likely to be an emotionally grasping parent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two chief elements make work interesting: first, the exercise of skill, and second, construction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the rest, for the sake of a livelihood, prostitute their skill to purposes which they believe to be harmful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without self-respect genuine happiness is scarcely possible.
And the man who is ashamed of his work can hardly achieve self-respect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habit of viewing life as a whole is an essential part both of wisdom and of true morality [...]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent purpose is not enough to make life happy, but it is an almost indispensable condition of a happy life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Impersonal interests&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of the defects of modern higher education that it has become too much a training in the acquisition of certain kinds of skill, and too little an enlargement of the mind and heart by an impartial survey of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Effort and resignation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half the useful work in the world consists of combating the harmful work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful collection of short but powerfully brimming texts, on racism, but really, on humanity itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From personal stories, to poetry, to speeches.
Maya comes off as an incredibly wise and kind woman through her writing.
I can only wish to once write so beautifully too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that brings me to a thought.
Must one have gone through suffering, pain, or exclusion to write compellingly?
Is suffering fundamental to the magical forces that cause us humans to resonate with a story?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I myself experienced suffering?
Did I just not recognize it properly, or has my life really been absent from any large suffering?
Though it is ostensibly everyone&#x27;s ideal, why does it feel so boring?
Does suffering cause meaning?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads me to only one conclusion.
Suffering is not to be avoided, but rather to be embraced as the crucial element of humanity&#x27;s experience of existence.
Does it mean that we should seek to suffer?
Maybe.
Imagine a life so comfortable that it shields and cushions you from real suffering.
To seek suffering then is to push past your comfort zone.
Because within it, you will never find suffering.
Pushing past it invites more significant entropy in your life.
The unknown is a cause of suffering in itself.
It might be uncomfortable, but I think it should be embraced.
To stand still and remain the same is to move backwards.
Not changing takes a toll on your mental self.
Thus to change is to live.
To change is to experience the unknown, slowly unfolding itself to you.
Internalizing small nuggets of the unknown is to live.
In looking back, we see a past self that was, but can never be attained again.
In looking back, we naturally also see our change.
And seeing our change gives meaning.
Reflection, awareness, and intentionality help to see.
Help to experience meaning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Ursula&#x27;s stories are magical. Though this bundle was a little harder to get through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stories all take place in some imaginary country in Eastern Europe, though there are enough mentions of the earthly surroundings to lend it a feel of convincing plausibility.
Ursula writes characters that actually convey deeper feelings.
They are more human than most characters I read about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the story &lt;em&gt;Brothers and sisters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that beautifully captures feelings between two brothers, their smaller sister, and a girl both brothers like.
Ursula writes the mundane into the literary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imaginary countries&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was also very good.
A short exploration of the children&#x27;s imagination, and what it does to a research assistant just starting out in life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursula&#x27;s writing style is without many frills while hitting unique sequences of emotional beats.
It is beautiful, meditative, and insightful.
The stories in this bundle did tend to bore me a little, I&#x27;m afraid to say.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Publishing about the historical connection between Christianity and psychedelics is fascinating and all, but it starts to get dangerous if you live in a world where the Vatican recently conquered most of continental Europe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Hiro was forced to abandon his excavations in Greece when the Vatican&#x27;s army of Nigerian cyborg princes invaded, he found himself fleeing across the world in his semi-hovering minivan. But now there was a brief time window to touch down in Iceland where his sister Mesha was staying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Iceland is a nice place,&quot; Hiro said, &quot;very few people to bother you and plenty of raw nature to disappear in.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You eternal dork,&quot; Mesha teased, &quot;but at least you keep on visiting your big sister. Although not nearly often enough.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe I would drop by more often if you decided to build a nice homecrate in between the vulcanoes here, wouldn&#x27;t you like that?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nah, I am just wrapping up my research for the Vulcanic Energy Consortium  here and then moving back home. But you have a point though, these vulcas are so immensely cute! I just don&#x27;t think I could miss my homecrate in Mount Fuji.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro shook his head with a smile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey,&quot; Mesha piped up from a lava sample she was coaxing through a series of tests, &quot;did you hear about the Ojos del Salado two days ago?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hm what? I am not the vulcanology nerd that you are sis.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dork. No it is terrible. Its magma chambers collapsed. Some eco-terrorism that escalated. The bastards. Ojos del Salado is nothing more than a smoldering caldera now.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, and?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ugh, anyway. A colleague was nearby and yesterday he called me in particular. Not about our work though. Apparently, while going through the remains, they have found more of the wine glasses and cups you have been publishing about recently.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got Hiro&#x27;s attention. &quot;Really? I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have a chance of investigating those anymore after what happened in Greece.&quot; He zoned out for a moment. &quot;But of course, the early Inca people must have gone through similar rituals as the Greeks and the Christians. I need to get to them before the Vatican does.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please be careful Hiro,&quot; Mesha said, &quot;I&#x27;m sure the Vatican wouldn&#x27;t want to see you picking up your research again. I dare not think about what they would do to you then.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will sis, it is just..&quot; Hiro hesitated, &quot;.. I just need to know. Not just for myself. Also for mother.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, I know.. you told me already so many times,&quot; Mesha said. Her eyes puffed a bit red, but not from the countless hours of peering over hot lava.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro decided to leave that same evening again. Though he had originally planned to stay one night, he felt an immediate pressure to get to Chile as fast as he could. With his backpack thrown in, plenty of fresh water and canned beans stocked, and his makeshift tandoor salvaged from a Punjabi wedding properly cleaned again, Hiro closed all doors and set his hydrogen cells to fuel up. Looking back at his sister, he saw her wiping the dirt and soot from her cheeks. Hiro hugged her as if it might be the last time they would see each other.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he was off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winds across the Atlantic ocean seemed to be picking up strength, causing a few seagulls to make emergency landings on the roof of Hiro&#x27;s minivan. Waves reached higher, trying to lick the wheels. But the minivan was hovering at a comfortable enough height, speeding across the blue vastness. It would take Hiro slightly longer to reach the South-American continent now though. Best estimates told him he would be there in twenty-four hours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gave him some time to reorganize his research. Hiro sifted through his chemical analyses of the ritual cups and glasses they found in Greek spiritual sites. Traces of hyoscyamus niger, datura stramonium, and other hallucinogenic plants. Greeks mixed them with a beer from barley. They seemed to play an important role in spiritual temples where people from across the area came to experience a sort of death before death. And there was archaeochemical evidence of warriors consuming these drinks in rituals meant to take them on a journey &quot;to the Beyond.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its significant role in the spiritual side of life, the same vision-enducing rituals must have been present at the time large parts of the Bible were being written. Hiro had been connecting the two in a few recent publications, until the Vatican decided it didn&#x27;t like the direction he was going. Truth was that he needed to collect more data and evidence anyway. By finding out more on these rituals, he might come closer to undermining the de jure divinity enforced by the Vatican.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro drifted off for a couple of hours. When he awoke again, his minivan had brought him to a small settlement of tents not far from the base of the Ojos del Salado caldera. Looked like the campsite of the researchers Mesha was in contact with. He jumped out and was met by a middle-aged woman with heavy eyebrows and a bronze tone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hiro, isn&#x27;t Mesha with you?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ehh excuse me? No I left her a day ago in Iceland.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shit. Then it might be true after all.&quot; The woman streaked a hand through her hair shakily and averted her eyes constantly, never having them rest anywhere for longer than a second.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don&#x27;t know?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#x27;ve been crossing the Atlantic ocean.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah of course.&quot; The woman continued, &quot;We received message that Mesha has been abducted. A few hours ago. Somalian assassins. People say it was the Vatican.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What... why?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but, people say it is because of you. The Vatican is trying to get to...&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before the woman could finish her sentence, she was cut off by screams from the campsite. Wildly looking around, Hiro now saw what others clearly saw too. Out of the caldera came a stream of black flying vehicles. Still smoldering, they picked up speed and headed straight for the campsite. There was no doubt about what they were as Hiro noticed the unmistakable shape of the popemobile, but then sleeker and deadlier. The personal guard of the pope. They most likely didn&#x27;t want to peacefully investigate the psychedelic wine glasses with him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro dashed back to his minivan and kicked off. While he was zooming low over land, the popemobiles diverted course to follow him. Hiro, thinking of his sister, set his jaw. After that, it was just a chase scene.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/books/snow-crash/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Snow Crash is a fascinating cyberpunk classic with great world building but a plot that does not live up to the same enthusiasticism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re mostly following Hiro and Y.T. in their lives as they get entangled in a few threads.
The story takes its sweet time to kick off the plot, which basically doesn&#x27;t boil down to anything more than stopping a bad guy who wants to take over the world.
The unique strengths of Snow Crash lie somewhere else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Neal presents an amazingly intricate and fleshed out world of semi-dystopian cyberpunk.
The novel was still brimming with cool ideas, and that is almost thirty years after it was first published.
I can only imagine how fascinating this must have been back in nineteen ninety-two.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I enjoyed most about this book, were its chapters where Hiro was discussing with his Librarian daemon about ancient civilizations.
This included creation myths of Sumerian culture, their influence on later civilizations, possible conspiracies surrounding the bible.
These chapters (27, 28, 30, 33) precisely hook into what I was already interested in recently, after my investigations into historical cultures and their food.
Then, in chapter 56 and 57, Hiro gives a nice summary of his interpretation of what is going on in the world.
He traces the full history of informational viruses with biological components, and how they kickstarted human civilization.
To ultimately survive throughout time, despite monotheistic and pluralistic counter-tendencies, as the cult of Asherah.
Neal manages to mention just enough historically plausible things onto which he can extrapolate his fictional theories and interpretations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neal was also the one to coin the term &lt;em&gt;Metaverse&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, in Snow Crash.
In the novel, it refers to the collective virtual space accessed through terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality on your goggles.
He is also the one who popularised the term &lt;em&gt;avatar&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to mean online virtual body.
The Metaverse contains many references to real world computing culture, but adding plenty of fictional elements to it, which makes it a very rich illusion while reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would definitely recommend to read this nine-hundred+ page novel, to experience the fantasy of cyberpunk from one of its most influential sources.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <title>Exploring the life vibes of Simon Sarris</title>

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/simon-sarris/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;Simon woont samen met zijn vrouw Simi (Simplicity) in zuid New Hampshire tussen pine woods in een huis dat hij zelf ontworpen en gebouwd heeft.
Zijn posts op Medium (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonsarris.medium.com&#x2F;designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41&quot;&gt;deel I&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; en &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonsarris.medium.com&#x2F;designing-a-new-old-home-part-2-2a5ea1a1b2b3&quot;&gt;deel II&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) waren mijn eerste kennismaking met hem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simons aesthetic is er een van een simpel en bewust leven.
Hij is grote voorstander van het zelf maken van dingen, in contrast met de compulsieve consumptie die zich nu veelal in de samenleving voordoet.
Hij terraformt zijn land, bouwt er tuinen, boomgaarden, kippenhokken, bloemen, terrassen en nog meer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samen met Simi heeft hij recentelijk een baby gekregen.
De omgeving voor het kindje is vol met fysieke prikkelingen en avontuur, verse pasta, dieren, stoffen, vuur, bloemen, zand, houten meubels en vloeren, bomen, natuur.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon schrijft: &quot;Most of my life is very mundane.&quot;
Maar dat is voor hem reden om te leven zoals hij leeft.
Door bewust memories te maken en deze vast te leggen in fotografie en schrijven, haalt hij veel meer voldoening uit het leven, dat in principe voor bijna iedereen uit veel saaie momenten zal bestaan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my life felt like waiting. Much of it unnecessarily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon benadrukt dat wat hij nastreeft, is to be &lt;strong&gt;making things&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deze hele sfeer doet me ook denken aan de Earthsea cycle van Ursula K. Le Guin; bewuste en minimalistische aandacht voor de schoonheid van het leven en een omarming van haar traagheid.
Een romantisering van het leven in goede zin, of tenminste, op een wijze die met mij resoneert.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zie ook enkele threads van Simons twitteraccount:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Een passage over het doel van het leven die ik recentelijk las:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To laugh often and much; to win the respect of the intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here. This is to have succeeded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;painting-a-picture-with-words&quot;&gt;Painting a picture with words&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping outside, the pinewood forest greets me with fresh and tingling smells.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello birds,&quot; I say.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the birds greet me back with joyful twittering.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave the wooden door open, inviting the world inside, and walk past the tagliatelle strands drying draped across our cotton spun threads.
My bare feet softly kiss the black earth as I enter our vegetable gardens.
Bright green crops of lettuce, darker green bok choy leaves, spring onion, carrots, petite zucchinis, shiny aubergines, and happy heads of garlic.
Whole sections of bean plants; black turtle beans, fava beans, soy beans, cow peas, and all types of lentils.
Just further ahead there are larger plots of grains; buckwheat, teff, spelt.
The gardens grow and provide all the fuel for our human vessels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We care for the garden and the earth, and the garden cares for us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife is sitting among the flowers, with a pile of books surrounding her.
I place one hand in her neck and offer a loving kiss on her forehead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here is your tea, babe,&quot; I say.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thanks love.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A bit dull.
The futurism in the stories did little resonating with me.
This should not be an issue in itself, but sadly most stories were not very engaging either.
They lacked significant progress or character progression.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A great novella that pulls you in for an engaging ride where you won&#x27;t even notice that you are just reading a novella.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maryrobinettekowal.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;i-am-43-today-have-a-novella-as-a-party-favor&#x2F;&quot;&gt;online&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Robinette crafts a nice little buddy detective tale, with a Chinese-American detective and a police AI system.
Character interactions are exquisite and the story is well paced.
The way our protagonist Scott Huang thinks about and interacts with the AI Metta (of which his personal interface is modeled after Mae West) poses interesting questions about the extent to which AI can be legal persons on themselves.
The world is briefly revealed to contain &lt;em&gt;freelance AI&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is a fascinating concept, but sadly underexplored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hang on– freelance?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metta nodded. “Though artificial intelligences have not been recognized as people, Jarrett Tovar, our creator, sets each AI up as a corporation. An AI that is not leasing its services is called a freelancer.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you are…?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leased. We call it indentured.” She smiled. “The chassis are very expensive so this is a way to pay off our start-up costs when we first come into the world. Once my lease is up, I’ll be able to freelance but being in the Metta line I’m more likely renew the lease. I like my job and it requires a contract with accompanying vows in order to be granted full access to the city. Other AI don’t have that sort of need so may be more likely to go freelance.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story sets up the detective-esque reveal satisfyingly, with a certain degree of predictable unpredictability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last interesting note I want to make.
The police AI called Metta is backed up very regularly; multiple times per day.
I remember reading about the AI democratization in the era of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.14165&quot;&gt;GPT-3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, an article by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thegradient.pub&#x2F;ai-democratization-in-the-era-of-gpt-3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Gradient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
There they pose that the GPT-3 neural network model is already so large that it can not easily be moved off the cluster of machines it was trained on.
This naturally gives rise to a few questions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did these AI backups work then?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long would a backup be retained?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many computer clusters does the police department have access to?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, let&#x27;s not dive in too deep here.
The story was great!
And a great example of how to write sweeping short fiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An amazing book on Indian cuisine, as recommended by Mark Bittman, is &lt;em&gt;Classic Indian Cooking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Julie Sahni, from 1980.
Another nice source of inspiration is &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=29ZP8ADQJ1Y&quot;&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; restaurant owner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some breads (there are way more though):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chapati&quot;&gt;Chapati&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;em&gt;unleavened flatbread baked on a griddle&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naan&quot;&gt;Naan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;em&gt;leavened, tandoor- or oven-baked flatbread&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is apparently more &quot;restaurant&quot; like, in contrast to&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paratha&quot;&gt;Paratha&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;em&gt;unleavened flatbread, really popular every-day bread&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Simple legumes with yogurt salad and rice in my mother&#x27;s kitchen, Tilburg, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading through &lt;em&gt;Classic Indian Cooking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Julie Sahni and found lots of interesting legume and vegetable dishes.
Peculiarly, Julie spells it as &lt;em&gt;channe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, while it currently seems to be much more commonly spelled as &lt;em&gt;chana&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; when referring to chickpea dishes.
Anyway, &lt;em&gt;safaid&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; means that we have a chickpea dish in a fragrant, light, ginger sauce.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chickpeas&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ginger&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground coriander&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground cardamom&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemon juice&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground pepper corns&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chopped tomato&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fry the onion in a good quantity of oil over medium-high.
Then we add our aromatics; garlic and ginger, frying for a few more minutes.
Throw in our spices: coriander, cardamom, pepper and toast for a moment.
Add the tomato and simmer until the oil begins to separate.
Pour in reserved chickpea liquid and our lemon juice, together with some water and salt.
Cover and simmer until we get a consistency of a pulpy gravy, then add the chickpeas themselves, and continue simmering.
Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with onion slices and chilies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie recommends this to be served with &lt;em&gt;poori&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is a fried flat bread.
I plan on making this another time, but now I served it with rice (preferably basmati).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made palak raita (spinach and yogurt salad) on the side, to balance out the safaid channe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tear off the hard stems of your spinach: fold them in half along the stem and then pull it out.
Lightly blanch the spinach in properly salted water at a rolling boil.
Get them out and push as much liquid out of them as possible, before coarsely chopping them.
Mix yogurt and sour cream (3:1), cumin, coriander, and black pepper in a bowl and thoroughly refrigerate them.
When ready to serve, stir the spinach and salt through the seasoned yogurt; sprinkle with additional cumin and coriander for garnish.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Mangoes in cream from Julie Sahni, served as dessert to the meal for my parents detailed above, Tilburg, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A light and refreshing dessert from mangoes and &lt;em&gt;rabadi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (a thickened milk sauce).
Cut up some mangos into large pieces, sprinkle with chopped walnutes, cover, and chill thoroughly.
Put the rabadi and some sugar in a blender until it is reduced to a smooth sauce.
Transfer to a bowl, cover, and chill.
Serve the mango slices and pass the rabadi sauce on the side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do I actually make the &lt;em&gt;rabadi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring milk to a boil in a heavy pan, stirring constantly (careful attention is crucial; we don&#x27;t want the milk to stick to the bottom).
Lower the heat and simmer the milk for forty-five to sixty minutes.
Stir very frequently, scraping down the sides and preventing the formation of a skin on top (because that hinders evaporation).
We are looking for a reduction to roughly thirty-three percent of the original quantity of milk.
Cool for a few minutes, transfer to a bowl and refrigerate.
While cooling, it will reduce the quantity to about twenty-five percent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;My first try at chapati in my mother&#x27;s kitchen, Tilburg, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian breads!
My heart is delighted every time I think about them.
Chapati is a very common staple, especially in Northern India (Southern parts are apparently more into rice).
It is also known as &lt;em&gt;roti&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but I believe that might be a more generic term for breads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chapati&quot;&gt;Chapati&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an unleavened flatbread made from whole-wheat flour.
The whole-wheat flour is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atta_flour&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;atta&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and is actually a bit different from the one I can buy in Western supermarkets.
In Indian &lt;em&gt;atta&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the entire wheat kernel is ground to a fine powder, while our whole-wheat flour is much coarser in texture.
People often also sift the atta flour to pick out the remaining bran flakes (outer layer of the kernel).
Using this flour then delivers a silky smooth texture that offers little resistance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Sahni has two recommendations when you cannot find atta flour.
Either, sift whole-wheat flour and throw away all the bran flakes (this quantity might be shocking).
Or, mix the whole-wheat flour with all-purpose flour (2:1).
The latter is what I opted for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Sahni is very adamant on the uniquely Indian preparation of the dough.
The distinguishing factor is the importance of water: its addition to the dough must be very precise, and kneading is done with water instead of flour.
There are three steps in the preparation: mixing, kneading, and resting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place flour in a bowl, and pour in the water in a stream (fast at first) while mixing it in with your other hand to moisten it so that it gathers into a mass.
Always irk on the low side of adding water.
Only if the dough feels a bit too dry, add a little more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Indian method of kneading is also unique.
Firstly, prepare a small bowl filled with some water and put it near your working space.
Form a fist and dip your knuckles into the water.
Knead the dough by pressing your knuckles into it repeatedly, as though punching it.
(I can&#x27;t deny that at some points I got a bit carried away and actually started punching my dough.)
Simultaneously, push and spread away the dough.
Lift one edge of the dough and fold it back over itself.
Continue this kneading ritual for about ten to fifteen minutes, while dipping your knuckles in water from time to time.
We are looking for a very soft and pliable dough, that springs back when you quickly push your finger into it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resting relaxes the dough such that it becomes less resistant to stretching and rolling.
Julie notes that the temperature in Indian kitchens — ranging between 38 and 48 ℃  — is ideal for the dough, because it allows it to ferment slightly, thereby causing it to rise.
This makes the dough light, airy, and spongy (as though it leavened slightly).
To mimic this in my non-tropical kitchen, I put the dough in an oven with only the lights turned on.
Cover the bowl with a moist towel or sheet of plastic wrap.
Rest for at least half an hour.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut the dough into small rounds, roughly pat them flat and cover both sides in a light coating of flour to prevent it from sticking to your work bench or rolling pin.
Do this one-by-one.
Roll the patty into a thin round circle by actually rolling the rolling pin in a brisk back-and-forth motion.
We are not Europeans (making tarts, pies, or quiches) who only spread out a dough in a single direction (away or toward oneself); it does not properly &lt;em&gt;stretch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the dough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gently place the bread on a hot griddle or pan until the first side is cooked and has several brown spots.
Flip, and bake the other side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack up the breads folded into kitchen paper or thick napkins.
This keeps the bread warm and prevents the bottom ones from becoming moist as they stack up and the steam cannot escape anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve chapati with anything you like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing all this, chapati is nothing more than flour and water (3:1).
You can add a little bit of salt to taste, but in general, you&#x27;re going to eat it with dishes that are rich in taste already, so there might not actually be a need to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;khichdi&quot;&gt;Khichdi&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Northern Indian khichdi in my room in Helsinki, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian cuisines are deliciously plenty and complex to break into.
So many different regions, people, ingredients, etc.
Khichdi seems to be a popular dish in many regions, although mostly in the northern part of the country.
For inspiration I read through &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Khichdi&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and found a popular recipe on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SYWtizV5oCI&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat some oil and infuse with cumin seeds (and asafoetida, if you have some).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic, ginger =&amp;gt; in.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onion&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chopped fresh tomatoes and green chilies&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a few minutes I also added some green peas&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more spices; turmeric, chili, garam masala&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add and fry your rice and lentils (1:1)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover with water and simmer with lid on for a while&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For serving, we top the khichdi with a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tempering_(spices)&quot;&gt;tadka&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; tempered spices.
The fat of the oil carries the spices beautifully.
I tempered some chili flakes, cumin seeds, and cardemom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;spinach-dal&quot;&gt;Spinach dal&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onions, garlic, coriander seeds, chili&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomato, cumin, turmeric, salt&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinach&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve with basmati rice&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Punjabi style black-eyed peas curry in spicy onion and tomato gravy, in my room in Amsterdam, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearty black-eyed peas curry from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Punjab&quot;&gt;Punjab region&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the Indian subcontinent.
I first stumbled on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;food&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;25&#x2F;20-best-curry-recipes-sam-jones-lobia-black-eyed-bean-curry&quot;&gt;a recipe by Sam Jones from The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that piqued my interest for a quick weeknight meal.
Then I naturally looked for an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ir1mWTJEQXY&quot;&gt;authentic source&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
It&#x27;s satisfying to recognize the different types of Indian breads that get recommended to eat alongside this curry (chapati, paratha, roti), after I recently did some research into them using Julie Sahni&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;Classic Indian Cooking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I fried garlic, ginger, and a few hot chilies in butter on medium-high heat until it took the raw edge off.
Sprinkled in a healthy dose of powders: turmeric, coriander, cumin.
Stir for a minute.
Add in onion, layer over some salt to draw out moisture more quickly, and simmer for five minutes.
I then poured in some tomato passata, sliced up cherry tomatoes, and a spoon of mango chutney.
Simmer for a while (maybe until you see some fat separated from the tomato sauce).
I threw in a tin of black-eyed peas, including their liquid (be mindful of whether yours is salted or not; if it is, I suggest rinsing the beans first and throwing in fresh water with them instead, got to be in control of your salts).
Continue simmering, lightly mashing some beans according to personal preference.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served it in my new wooden bowl with basmati rice and fresh cilantro, and a quickly pickled cucumber-onion salad on the side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;T.J.&#x27;s wholesome story that ignites (if it wasn&#x27;t there yet) a sense of wonder about our world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deliberately picked this book—for young adults and others who enjoy the &quot;YA-genre&quot;—as a feel-good piece sandwiched between a few heavier books.
For me, it sits in between the realistic pessimism about sustainable innovation from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maxcrone.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;house-in-the-cerulean-sea&#x2F;books&#x2F;numbers-dont-lie&quot;&gt;Numbers don&#x27;t lie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and a book on food culture and history dense with enthusiasm-fueled research-rabbit-holes instigators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved this book for its strong story and setup, of which you can clearly see the dramatic outlines sketched, but T.J. manages to engage you nonetheless.
It never really reached the unputdownable quality for me, but it certainly takes you along for a ride of guaranteed feelings.
The children&#x27;s characters have a nice uniqueness to them, but the main emotional development happens through Linus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick read with enough endearing elements to make this story a good time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Non-traditional menemen with freshly-baked pita in my kitchen in Helsinki.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pronouncing this dish already feels delicious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I made today is definitely not a traditional recipe though.
See the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uFxXw0eSSC0&quot;&gt;video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by J. Kenji López-Alt for a much better idea of traditional menemen (and nice vibes in general).
Didn&#x27;t have proper green peppers, so I had to make do with the much too sweet red bellpepper.
Worst of all, I added mixed beans in there too, because it was still in my fridge and had to be used before I went out to a cottage in mid-Finland for the weekend.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, backing up a bit.
Menemen is a Turkish dish often eaten for breakfast, kind of similar to the more widespread shakshouka.
There is deep disagreement in Turkish society about the addition of onions to the dish.
See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Menemen_(food)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a short overview.
Of course I added onions though.
Sauté onion and pepper first, in a good glug of olive oil.
Add grated&#x2F;diced tomato and simmer for around ten minutes on relatively low heat.
Season with salt and plenty of black pepper.
Just before serving, throw in a couple of eggs, and very carefully scramble them through the sauce.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served these with freshly baked, buttery pita breads.
See the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baker_percentage&quot;&gt;baker&#x27;s percentage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; breakdown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flour&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water (50%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy (15%) (although I used oat milk)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugar (3%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt (2%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeast (2%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olive oil (1%)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon serving, top menemen with crumbled feta.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Turkish pizza with falafel and vegetables, as decadent brunch, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widely known in the Netherlands as &quot;Turkish pizza&quot; instead. Normally, one would prepare this with ground meat, but alternatives based on plant proteins work enviably well too. Lahmacun is relatively simple, so it is perfect for a relaxed Sunday brunch. See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lahmacun&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for rough directions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is nice to prepare a lighter, fluffy dough. Thus, leavened. See the pita recipe above. However, we want to roll these ones out rather thinly, so that when we bake them (in the spirit of tandoor, ideally) they become slightly crispy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the spread, fry a chopped onion with garlic and our plant protein crumbles (for lack of a better word). Whisk in tomato puree, thinning it out with a few drops of water. Add spices such as (spicy) paprika. Stir and simmer for some ten minutes, until it is nicely done and spreadable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get everything together. Spread the spread, and wrap in vegetables of your choice. We used some lettuce, cucumber, tomato. For a more decadent lunch, add some spicy falafel, and drizzle on a yogurt-based cucumber-onion pickle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;baklava&quot;&gt;Baklava&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;A sheet of baklava in my mother&#x27;s kitchen in Tilburg, 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immensely popular dessert can actually be made really easily. There isn&#x27;t much of a recipe to speak of. I just referenced the &lt;em&gt;preparation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; lemma on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baklava#Preparation&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baklava basically consists of three parts:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chopped nuts (in this case, pistachio)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filo pastry (thin, unleavened dough; individual layers brushed with fat)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syrup or honey (simple syrup is equal parts sugar and water, heated up and stirred until the sugar dissolves)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the filo pastry is quite challenging to prepare if you fancy doing this from scratch. Luckily, there are pretty good ones for sale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grind up the pistachio. Place some layers of filo in an oven sheet pan or tray. Spread pistachio. Place more filo on top. Brush over some fat and cut the whole slab into geometric forms that tickle your fancy. Bake for twenty to thirty minutes, depending on your desired level of crispiness. Once out of the oven, pour over your syrup or honey.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An amazing exercise in developing wordly intuition based on realism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaclav Smil wields numbers to paint a very interesting picture to help us understand how the world as we know it is able to keep on running like it is doing.
I found this exercise very insightful.
Maybe the most ground-shaking idea that I gained from this book, was the sense of how dependent the world still is on fossil fuels.
There are so many processes behind the functioning of our world, that are nearly impossible or at least very difficult to transition to sustainable forms of energy.
Erecting wind turbines and keeping them running inherently uses fossil fuels, for example.
Planes, container ships, plastics, steel; staples of our society, are all virtually infeasible without fossil fuels.
At times it is depressing to realize how difficult of a task it is to guide humanity to a sustainable balance with the planet.
But it is irrefutably important to gain this knowledge, because reasoning from a more realistically grounded view of world will allow us to better attack these challenges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reminds me of the field of progress studies, to which I was first introduced by Jason Crawford from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rootsofprogress.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Roots of Progress&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book with seventy-one short essays (part of them republished, part of them appearing in print for the first time) is split up in seven broad themes.
Let me just go over them in order, noting down interesting tidbits along the way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;People&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the things discussed here, are indicators of &lt;em&gt;quality of life&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Vaclav proposes &lt;strong&gt;infant mortality&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, because low rates are impossible to achieve without a combination of critical factors that define quality of life—good healthcare, proper maternal and infant nutrition, sanitary living conditions, social support for disadvantaged families.
Infant immortality thus becomes a single variable that captures something that others have devised complex multi-variable systems for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People all over the world grow taller because of better health and nutrition (The Netherlands still practically tops the charts for tallest citizens).
This might be attributed to the role of milk consumption during childhood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are monsters of sweating.
We can sweat the most, and our bodies do not require the deficit to be made up instantly.
By being able to heavily regulate our bodily temperature, humans can outlast antelopes, deer, and kangaroos.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Megacity&quot;&gt;Megacities&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have more than ten million people living in them.
And there are an increasing number of them in our world, as the ultimate symbol of the shift from countryside to urban living.
It also perfectly illustrates the receding influence of Western countries and the rise of Asian countries.
More than sixty percent of the megacties are in Asia.
African megacities like Lagos and Kinshasa are embodiments of disorganization and environmental decay.
Water and air quality in Chinese megacities is bad.
Murder rate in Rio de Janeiro approaches 40 per 100,000.
Cities continue to attract new people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;countries&quot;&gt;Countries&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States isn&#x27;t all that exceptional as people might fantasize.
Europe&#x27;s decades of peace and prosperity are to be appreciated.
Japan seems to be on a decline.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Japan&#x27;s] swift post–Second World War ascent ended in the late 1980s, and it’s been downhill ever since: in a single lifetime, from misery to an admired—and feared—economic superpower, then on to the stagnation and retreat of an aging society.
The Japanese government has been trying to find some way out—but radical reforms are not easy in a gerrymandered country that still cannot seriously contemplate even moderate-scale immigration and that is yet to make real peace with its neighbors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#x27;s rise has been swift and threatening for the Western world, but it seems to be headed in a similar direction as Japan.
India might become the new China, so to say.
Its population will soon surpass China&#x27;s.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;machines-designs-devices&quot;&gt;Machines, designs, devices&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1880s brought forth many modern inventions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1880s were miraculous; they gave us such disparate contributions as antiperspirants, inexpensive lights, reliable elevators, and the theory of electromagnetism—although most people lost in their ephemeral tweets and in Facebook gossip are not even remotely aware of the true scope of this quotidian debt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric motors power modern civilization; from tiny DC devices used for smartphone vibrations (with power requirements at a small fraction of a watt), to motors powering the TGV (6.5 to 12.2 megawatt), and stationary motors for power compressors, fans, and conveyors (exceeding 60 megawatts).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel engines are pretty efficient and they find their use mostly as enablers of massively centralized industrial production and irreplaceable prime movers of globalization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesels power virtually all container ships and all carriers of vehicles and bulk commodities such as oil, liquefied natural gas, ores, cement, fertilizers, and grain.
They also power nearly all trucks and freight trains.
Most of the items that readers of this book eat or wear are transported at least once, and usually many times, by diesel-powered machines, often from other continents: clothes from Bangladesh, oranges from South Africa, crude oil from the Middle East, bauxite from Jamaica, cars from Japan, computers from China.
Without the low operating costs, high efficiency, high reliability, and great durability of diesel engines, it would have been impossible to reach the extent of globalization that now defines the modern economy.
Over more than a century of use, diesel engines have increased both in capacity and efficiency.
The largest machines in shipping are now rated at more than 81 megawatts (109,000 horsepower), and their top net efficiency is just above 50 percent—better than that of gas turbines, which are at about 40 percent.
And diesel engines are here to stay.
There are no readily available mass-mover alternatives that could keep integrating the global economy as affordably, efficiently, and reliably as Diesel’s machines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fuels-and-electricity&quot;&gt;Fuels and electricity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Glenn Seaborg, a Nobelist and the then-chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, predicted that nuclear reactors would generate nearly all the world’s electricity by 2000.
Seaborg envisioned giant coastal “nuplexes” desalinating sea water; geostationary satellites powered by compact nuclear reactors for broadcasting TV programs; nuclear-powered tankers; and nuclear explosives that would alter the flow of rivers and excavate underground cities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promises of nuclear energy remained unfulfilled, because of stalled projects to generate electricity from fission (as demand for electricity fell in the 1980s), and other problems.
Accidents like those at Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986), and Fukushima (2011) provided further evidence for those opposed to fission.
There are plenty of high costs outside planned budget in construction.
The problem of finding an acceptable way for permanent storage of waste material has remained unsolved (the geologic storage facility in Finland is a world&#x27;s first, see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aoy_WJ3mE50&quot;&gt;Tom Scott&#x27;s video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
This results in Western societies being reluctant to adopt nuclear energy.
China and India are expanding.
Things we could do are 1) using better reactor designs, and 2) acting on waste storage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the fossil fuels we need to get electricity from wind:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smelting of iron ore in a blast furnace for the production of steel.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naptha and gas for the synthesis of plastic and fiber glass.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diesel for ships, trucks, and construction machinery.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lubricant for gearboxes throughout the lifespan of a wind turbine.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries are too small.
There is a need for more compact, more flexible, larger-scall, less costly electricity storage.
Li-ion batteries won&#x27;t be sufficient in case a (mega)city is cut off from powerlines and needs to sustain for a few days on its own.
Current solutions trying to address this, are large pumped hydro storage plants that basically pump water to a higher reservoir during night time (when electricity is cheap) to gain energy potential for periods of peak demand.
Pumped storage accounts for more than ninety-nine percent of the world&#x27;s storage capacity, but it has an inevitable energy loss around twenty-five percent.
Many places also do not have mountains nearby to build such facilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container ships are very hard to make electric.
To have an electric ship whose batteries and motors weighed no more than the fuel and the diesel engine in today&#x27;s largest container vessels (carrying 23,756 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units)), we need batteries with an energy density more than ten times as high as today&#x27;s best Li-ion units.
In the past seventy years, the energy density hasn&#x27;t even quadrupled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Graph depicting the global percentual breakdown of energy sources over the last two hundred years. Figure by Vaclav Smil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal, crude oil, and natural gas together still account for nearly all global energy.
This is somewhat depressing to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But solar and wind electricity generation are now mature industries, and new capacities can be added quickly—increasing the pace of decarbonizing the electricity supply.
In contrast, several key economic sectors depend heavily on fossil fuels and we do not have any non-carbon alternatives that could replace them rapidly and on the requisite massive scales.
These sectors include long-distance transportation (now almost totally reliant on aviation kerosene for jetliners, and diesel, bunker fuel, and liquefied natural gas for container, bulk, and tanker vessels); the production of more than a billion tons of primary iron (requiring coke made from coal for smelting iron ores in blast furnaces) and more than 4 billion tons of cement (made in massive rotating kilns fired by low-quality fossil fuels); the synthesis of nearly 200 million tons of ammonia and some 300 million tons of plastics (starting with compounds derived from natural gas and crude oil); and space heating (now dominated by natural gas).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaclav&#x27;s conclusion:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities, rather than any wishful thinking, must guide our understanding of primary energy transitions.
Displacing 10 billion tons of fossil carbon is a fundamentally different challenge than ramping up the sales of small portable electronic devices to more than a billion units a year; the latter feat was achieved in a matter of years, the former one is a task for many decades.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On this page I will collect new fictional abstracts as I write them. Most of these short pieces will contain lots of dazzling jargon from the field of computer science and security, as to give some impression of plausibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will link to downloadable documents for each of these, that are also formatted to resemble scientific papers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, I had already been playing with the idea of writing creative but fictional abstracts as a nice mental exercise. What finally kicked me off was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islandstudies.ca&#x2F;sites&#x2F;vre2.upei.ca.islandstudies.ca&#x2F;files&#x2F;u2&#x2F;ISJ-2-2-2007-Anckar-pp193-208.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; paper from 2007 published in the &lt;em&gt;Island Studies Journal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, about &lt;em&gt;Archipelagos and Political Engineering&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the world has seen a large increase of cloud-based side-channel attacks targeting critical infrastructure of the planet. Researchers found a large share of these to originate from—as of yet—unknown species of life. Most forms of attack are exceptionally novel, but prior work has already proposed several effective mitigation techniques for attacks targeting global information networks, multimedia feeds, and industrial supply chains. Highlighting a forgotten but
potentially catastrophic area, this paper quantifies the impact of these attacks on planetary-wide ecosystems—including oceanic life, vulcanic microbial singularity, equatorial rainforests, and aerial-synthetic lifeforms. The findings suggest that cloud-based side-channel attacks affect these systems in unprecedented ways, disturbing planetary balance and catalyzing natural disasters that have the potential of wiping out humanity. This paper proposes a partial solution that mitigates the
effectiveness of some side-channels attacks. However, further work is desperately needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Essays on the ability to take action that I found to be leaning heavily towards the introspection side, while still conveying surprisingly concrete points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second book in the bundled series of essays by the LessWrong community, titled &lt;em&gt;A map that reflects the territory&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, of which I previously read &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;books&#x2F;epistemology&quot;&gt;Epistemology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I will quickly remember and discuss three concepts&#x2F;ideas laid out over four essays that most stuck with me; &lt;em&gt;an explanation of insight meditation and enlightenment&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;meta-honesty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;being a robust agent&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-explanation-of-enlightenment&quot;&gt;An explanation of enlightenment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaj Sotala attempts to provide an explanation of his experience with intellectually understanding Looking and enlightenment. &lt;em&gt;Looking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is used as a term similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kensh%C5%8D&quot;&gt;kenshō&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but without the Zen connotation. One of the key concepts is &lt;strong&gt;cognitive fusion&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;; a person fusing together with the content of a thought or emotion, so that the content is experienced as an objective fact about the world rather than a mental construct. This is not always bad, but it is argued that it always better to be conscious of when this is happening. If fusion would then rationally be deemed to provide positive value, one can decide to continue the fusion. I tend to disagree with the effectiveness of this. In my experience, making this conscious decision already gets me out of the true cognitive fusion that would have been useful, and instead I can only really reach a not-completely-fused fusion. Anyhow, cognitive fusion trades flexibility for focus. Defusing then becomes the concept of reaching towards a more conscious decision beforehand. Kaj makes several observations about the depth of defusion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, meditation can be used as a method for cognitive defusion. By focusing on disregarding content of distractions, you purposefully hold of fusion with thoughts and emotions. A further step is to split up your mental processes into subcomponents, but this requires a higher level of mental precision. As an example, Kaj poses the following three subcomponental points: 1) Me feeling unhappy, 2) Mental image of a happy person, 3) Thought that I can&#x27;t be happy. They then relate this to the concept of Looking:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being able to develop the necessary mental sharpness to notice slightly lower-level processing stages in your cognitive processes, and study the raw concepts which then get turned into higher-level cognitive content, rather than only seeing the high-level cognitive content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaj&#x27;s second observation relates to leveraging Looking to understand suffering. A moment of discomfort is just a single moment. However, humans tend to do almost anything to avoid ending up there. This becomes the suffering. By Looking, one can identify how this &lt;em&gt;flinching away&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of discomfort produces the pain, and then stop doing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, suppose that one day, you happen to run into a complete stranger. You don&#x27;t think very much about needing to impress them, and as a result, you come off as relaxed and charming. The next day, you&#x27;re going on a date with someone you&#x27;re really strongly attracted to. You feel that it&#x27;s really really important for you to make a good impression, and because you keep obsessing about this thought, you can&#x27;t relax, act normal, and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; make a good impression. &lt;strong&gt;Defusing is hard if you actually care about the belief.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, to shatter this delusion of pain, one could practice the Buddhist &lt;em&gt;three marks&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and no-self. The fundamental delusion is the one where this fictional construct of I is mistaken for an actually-existing entity. As a result of this realization, desire and aversion towards specific states of mind (thus including suffering) cease.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Kaj observes that enlightenment might not actually be clearly visible for other people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] enlightenment means that you no longer experience emotional pain as aversive. In other words, you continue to have &quot;negative&quot; emotions like fear, anger, jealousy, and so on — you just don&#x27;t mind having them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] if you truly step outside your entire motivational system, then that leaves the part that just stepped out with &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; motivational system, leaving the existing one operating as normal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final recommendation is to not expect Looking at suffering to give you lots of positive emotions, nothing of the sorts is guaranteed. Besides, getting to the point of becoming enlightened requires training up a lot of mental precision, which you can then use to Look at so many other different things too!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;meta-honesty&quot;&gt;Meta-honesty&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer Yudowsky lays out the basics and the details of his concept of meta-honesty in two essays. Why is &lt;em&gt;meta-honesty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; needed anyway? Can&#x27;t you just always be honest? Eliezer identifies that always being honest leads to situations in practice where people are feeling crushed by the weight of their sense of duty. A different approach would be to &lt;em&gt;never say anything false&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, however, this leads to all sorts of situations in which people make exceptions that &quot;obviously&quot; don&#x27;t qualify for this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example Eliezer carries throughout both of his essays, is the scenario in which a nazi comes to your door to ask whether you are hiding Jews in your house (which in fact, you are, according to the scenario). Answering &quot;no&quot; is arguably the superior ethical choice, but it goes against your pledge of honesty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is meta-honesty then? &lt;strong&gt;Meta-honesty is the concept that you are always honest about what you will be honest about and what you would lie about.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer writes much on interactions surrounding the &quot;code of meta-honesty&quot; and what is acceptable to expect of others. He concludes that honesty on a meta-level is absolutely sacred, and meta-lying should be considered a crime against humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-a-robust-agent&quot;&gt;Being a robust agent&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond Arnold makes a case for why we want to improve ourselves to become a more robust, coherent agent. &lt;em&gt;Robustness&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is the quality of being able to succeed to novel challenges in complex domains. (Reminds me of one of my Bachelor courses on software engineering theory, where we also talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Robustness_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;software robustness&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.) I distilled the concrete advice into four points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine and understand your decision making process, and wield it deliberately&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be consistent and coherent in the way you make your decisions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be—and act to be—someone who others trust with knowledge and power&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find strategies that work in a messy game-theoretic environments&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The solarpunk genre is a promising new sound, and I enjoy the generally upbeat worlds, characters, and stories. However, some of these explorations forget to include much story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me not spend too much time on the weaker short stories included in this anthology. After all, every anthology must by some law of nature exhibit a range of quality in the stories it chooses to showcase.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#x27;t known about the solarpunk genre for long yet. After first learning of the premise, I set out to formulate my own perspective on it, before I dove into what other people wrote.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GXRlGULqHxg&quot;&gt;video essay on Blade Runner&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the Nerdwriter says something that I took to become a central dogma in my definition of the solarpunk genre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central problem of modernity isn&#x27;t humanity, it&#x27;s identity&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for a quick sketch of the context, I wrote the following.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass-clad, rounded towers slurp the sun&#x27;s light and convert it into earth&#x27;s current of power. Wireless energy is everywhere in a world where greenery no longer has to fight against progress, but can finally embrace it in her dance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean energy has been accomplished. Humans have learned to coexist and form societies with everyone. Cultures haven&#x27;t converged, but instead have entangled like the great vines decorating the cities. Has humankind beaten life? What more is there to reach for?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identity. What is our place as individuals? We are being born, but what can we add to life? People read, watch films, make photographs, listen to music. People dance, and climb, run, play, wrestle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does work look like? Everyone only works for one day every week. There are enough people available every day to keep things running. For the rest, everyone has a shared sense of responsibility for public spaces. All needs are provided for by machines. We just stick around to fix and improve them from time to time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then did I move on to others&#x27; work in the solarpunk genre.
By browsing through some YouTube talks, online art galleries, and other writings on the subject, I gathered a brief intuition for how people perceived this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will highlight a few stories from this collection that I liked most.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After introducing me to the word epistemology, the essays in this book gave me exceptionally well-crafted ideas on thinking, argumentation, and communication.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had seen and read some of the posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&quot;&gt;LessWrong&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before, and I was fascinated by the sheer effort put into the writing and arguments. These people are highly knowledgeable and experienced. Reading through a bunch of posts on yet another website did not feel as alluring anymore however, because I already spend a good deal of my day staring at screens. I ordered the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;books&quot;&gt;set of five books&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; bundling the best essays of 2018 by the LessWrong community. These five books are cute! Of size A6, they can just about travel with me in any pocket. Having these essays on paper actually made me read them. Greatly recommended.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ideas that significantly resonated with me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is the series of three essays by Alkjash in which he brings forth his &lt;em&gt;Babble and Prune algorithm&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;i42Dfoh4HtsCAfXxL&#x2F;babble&quot;&gt;Babble&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;wQACBmK5bioNCgDoG&#x2F;more-babble&quot;&gt;More Babble&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;rYJKvagRYeDM8E9Rf&#x2F;prune&quot;&gt;Prune&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). The idea pertains to how humans produce knowledge; first by babbling many random words, later filtering what goes through by some heuristic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Babble. Use a weak and local filter to randomly generate a lot of possibilities. Is the word the right part of speech? Does it lie in the same region of thingspace? Does it fit the context?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prune. Use a strong and global filter to test for the best, or at least a satisfactory, choice. With this word in the blank, do I actually believe this sentence? Does the word have the right connotations? Does the whole thought read smoothly?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting observation Alkjash makes, is that babies just babble a whole vocal range of &quot;words&quot;, and over time improve their Pruning filter via reinforcement learning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the problem of outsourcing your Babble too much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prune goes into overdrive when you outsource Babble. A bug I mentioned earlier is having way too strict of a Prune filter, compared to the quality of your Babble. This occurs particularly to people who read and listen much more than they write or speak. When they finally trudge into the attic and turn on that dusty old Babble generator, it doesn&#x27;t produce thoughts nearly as coherent, witty, or wise as their hyper-developed Pruned filter is used to processing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading this, I immediately felt like it applied to me. Only recently did I start making a conscious effort to &quot;dust off&quot; my Babble generator. And on top of that, I am never really convinced that what I am writing is of much added interesting value. How to push myself out of this? Personally it helps me tremendously to experience the inner satisfaction I derive from writing down my thoughts. It actually makes me draw out what I am thinking in a much more conscious manner than I would otherwise ever do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;NLBbCQeNLFvBJJkrt&#x2F;varieties-of-argumentative-experience&quot;&gt;classification of disagreements&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from Scott Alexander very interesting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;blog_images&#x2F;argument_hierarchy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Argument hierarchy&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially his thoughts on the &lt;em&gt;meta-debate&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; came across as very recognizable. In this type of argument, the discussion is about the debate itself rather than any of the concepts or arguments being debated. So much of what news media portray of national and international politics seems to never rise above the meta-debate. I also noticed that I myself am sometimes guilty of presenting not more than a handful of studies, which clearly favor a specific side of a discussion. This reminds me to put in more effort to strive towards seeking out or conducting proper surveys more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;tKwJQbo6SfWF2ifKh&#x2F;toward-a-new-technical-explanation-of-technical-explanation&quot;&gt;final essay&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of this book was a bit too difficult to fully grasp for me, partly because it built upon concepts described in other essays which also are pretty complex in their own right (and which I hadn&#x27;t read beforehand!) I am inspired to read more about the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B&#x2F;gears-in-understanding&quot;&gt;gears-level understanding&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would wholeheartedly recommend this book (and probably the rest of the bundle too, but I will come back to that later) to anyone who is interested in a rigorous and rational approach to thinking about life. Reading the essays of these people lifts my thinking and inspiration to a more conscious level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An amazingly well written narration with enviable depth of thought.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just collect all phrases and pieces I annotated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the inability to laugh comes an inability to acknowledge the contradictions inherent in every society and relationship, the multiplicity and clash of desires, the need to accept that one&#x27;s partner will never learn how to park a car, or wash out a bath or give up a taste for Joni Mitchell - but that one cares for them rather a lot nevertheless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauty is the promise of happiness&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Proust once said, classically beautiful women should be left to men without imagination&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people would never have fallen &#x27;in love if they had never heard of love&#x27;, aphorized La Rochefoucauld&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really her I love, I thought to myself as I looked again at Chloe reading on the sofa across the room, or simply an idea that collects itself around her mouth, her eyes, her face? In using her face as a guide to her soul, was I not perhaps guilty of mistaken metonymy, whereby an attribute of an entity is substituted for the entity itself?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovers cannot remain philosophers for long, they should give way to the religious impulse, which is to believe and have faith, as opposed to the philosophic impulse, which is to doubt and enquire. They should prefer the risk of &quot;being wrong and in love&quot; to &quot;being in doubt and without love&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was afforded a chance to mature thanks to the insights into my personality that Chloe afforded me. It takes the intimacy of a lover to point out facets of character that others simply don&#x27;t bother with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her casual reference to a past lover provided the necessary objectification for me to realize that, however special I was to her, I still existed within certain definitions (&#x27;a guy&#x27;, &#x27;my boyfriend&#x27;) - and that in in Chloe&#x27;s eyes, I was necessarily a simplified version of myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in resolving our need to love, we do not always succeed in resolving our need to long.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the skiing holiday (and much of my life generally) proceeded: anticipation in the morning, anxiety in the actuality, and pleasant memories in the evening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her apathy embodied the hope that by doing nothing, another might take the decision for her, that by displaying her indecision and frustration while not acting on it I would ultimately perform the move that she had needed (but been too scared) to make herself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, one calls individual actions good or bad quite irrespective of their motives but solely on account of their useful or harmful consequences. Soon, however, one forgets the origin of these designations and believes that the quality good and evil is inherent in the actions themselves, irrespective of their consequences...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Friedrich Nietzsche, &quot;Human, all too human&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have killed myself would have been to forget that I would be too dead to derive any pleasure from the melodrama of my own extinction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an Arabic saying that the soul travels at the pace of a camel. While most of us are led by the strict demands of timetables and diaries, our soul, the seat of the heart, trails nostalgically behind, burdened by the weight of memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mature love is marked by an active awareness of the good and bad within each person, it is full of temperance, it resists idealization, it is free of jealousy, masochism, or obsession, it is a form of friendship with a sexual dimension, it is pleasant, peaceful, and reciprocated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all more intelligent that we are capable, and awareness of the insanity of love has never saved anyone from the disease.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In calling for a monastic existence free of emotional turmoil, stoicism was simply trying to deny the legitimacy of certain potentially painful yet fundamental human needs. However brave, the stoic was in the end a coward at the point of perhaps the highest reality, at the moment of love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that a more complex lesson needed to be drawn, one that could play with the incompatibilities of love, juggling the need for wisdom with its likely impotence, juggling the idiocy of infatuation with its inevitability. Love had to be appreciated without flight into dogmatic optimism or pessimism, without constructing a philosophy of one&#x27;s fears, or a morality of one&#x27;s disappointments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Ful mudammas with quick pickled vegetables and fresh flatbread in my kitchen in Helsinki.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come to the conclusion that it is virtually impossible to ascribe a dish to a single country.
Either a country&#x27;s borders are quite arbitrary and thus do not necessarily contain a single culture.
This is the case with many African countries.
Or, countries in relative geographical vicinity have just been influenced by similar cultures, religions, invaders, and whatever else history threw at them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ful medames (which is the non-Arabic English spelling) actually originates in Egypt, from where it was exported across parts of the Arab, African, and Asian world.
Why am I putting this under Palestine then?
Well, while researching different versions of this dish, I also encountered a great Palestinian-American cook who made a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IQSWEt4l5xE&quot;&gt;Palestinian variation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
She noted that a real Palestinian version would use a mix of fava beans and chickpeas.
This is important, because the only fava beans I could find in Finnish shops were those mixed with chickpeas in a tin.
Looked like I had to go with the Palestinian variation after all!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No problem of course, it still tastes amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a slow heat, start by sizzling some minced garlic and ground cumin.
I also threw in some leftover habanero, but you can easily do without.
When your aromatics are lightly colored, throw in the drained and rinsed fava beans + chickpeas.
Up the heat a tad, and throw in a couple splashes of water.
Crack some salt and pepper to taste, and simmer away.
I was looking to properly soften up the beans, so they could easily be mushed later on.
Keep adding water if necessary.
Mash the ful to an appealing consistency, and ladle in a nicer serving bowl than I had access to.
Garnish with chopped tomato, parsley, lemon, and a good drizzle of olive oil.
I served it with some quickly pickled vegetables and fresh flatbread.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now apparently Palestinian traditional grandma&#x27;s scoop up the ful with onions that have been soaking in some good olive oil.
Naturally, I tried my hand at that too.
It is a bit intense, but good to have tried.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Lentil-aubergine-pomegranate stew served with rice in wooden bowl, in my kitchen in Amsterdam, 2021.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lentil, aubergine and pomegranate stew from the Gaza strip.
Inspired by a recipe from Yasmin Khan&#x27;s book &lt;em&gt;Zaitoun: Recipes from the Palestinian Kitchen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I casually browsed in the Waterstone&#x27;s in Amsterdam recently.
Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Palestinian_cuisine#Gaza&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;lifeandstyle&#x2F;2017&#x2F;feb&#x2F;02&#x2F;rummaniyeh-pomegranate-lentil-stew-recipe-palestinian-food-joudie-kalla-cook-residency&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tasteatlas.com&#x2F;rummaneyye&quot;&gt;Taste Atlas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place lentils in a saucepan and add enough water.
Put on middle-high heat, add ground cumin and coriander, and simmer for about fifteen minutes until the lentils begin to soften.
A quick note on the lentils to use: I had red lentils lying around, but these actually are too soft and lose their shape after cooking them down.
In the recipes I read, everyone suggests brown lentils instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, cut a few aubergines (peel the skin if you want) into cubes with two centimeter dimensionality.
Add them to the pan, along with eighty milliliters of pomegranate molasses, sumac, salt, pepper, and some olive oil.
Shimmer for a while.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fry some finely minced onions and garlic until soft, golden, and fragrant.
Set aside when finished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used some of that oil and aromatics to prepare my rice.
Quickly fried it in the pan, then added water and let it come up to a boil.
Add salt, turn heat down, and cover with a lid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the rice is cooked and you took it off the heat to rest for five minutes, swirl the onion-garlic mixture through the rummaniyya.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this would be served with a flatbread like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IhHphbIetBg&quot;&gt;taboon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; instead of rice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garnish with pomegranate seeds and some fresh herbs (mint, parsley), drizzle over some extra olive oil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;James Baldwin&#x27;s collection of essays has been powerful, in both message and prose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I will quickly note down what I thought about each individual essay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;everybody-s-protest-novel&quot;&gt;Everybody&#x27;s protest novel&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James argues why &quot;protest novels&quot; don&#x27;t work, or don&#x27;t touch upon a true solution. It comes down to the fact that all seem to accept — and argue within — the framework of reason perpetuated by society, that is, &lt;em&gt;pious christianity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, with its sins, concept of hell, and the striving towards god and heaven.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James calls this failure the &lt;em&gt;rejection of life&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. These so-called protest novels fail to truly express the human being, its beauty, dread, and power.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the novels James cites, I have never read. This made it a bit more confusing to really follow his arguments. In general, I found his arguments to be hidden deep underneath a layer of flowering prose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;many-thousands-gone&quot;&gt;Many thousands gone&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James sets out to explore what it means to be a Negro in America, by examining myths being perpetuated.
He argues that the sense of how Negroes live and endure is hidden from general America, because of two reasons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speed of the Negro&#x27;s public progress, which is highly complex, bewildering and kaleidoscopic. So much so, that he dare not pause to look back to the darkness which lies behind him.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The American psychology, of which James notes that it is literally unthinkable to see this change.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence that James writes that I think describes this American psychology, is as follows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans, unhappily, have the most remarkable ability to alchemize all bitter truths into an innocuous but piquant confection and to transform their moral contradictions, or public discussion of such contradictions, into a proud decoration, such as are given for heroism on the field of battle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Americans spun an alternate truth for themselves so they didn&#x27;t have to confront their past sins. This however also prevented them from truthfully observing the sometimes perilous lives of Negroes, which possibly lead to more denial and increased mutual hatred.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining lion&#x27;s share of this essay discusses the novel &lt;em&gt;Native son&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Richard Wright.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James criticizes the message brought forth by Richard as contributing more to an already established stereotype than breaking free and truthfully showing the lives of Negroes in America. He poses that it is not actually Bigger Thomas that we — the white American society — fear, even though he is the one who expresses his hatred and seeks vengeance, making him a part of the national statistics that lead to dehumanization of the Negro, but instead that we fear all those characters surrounding Bigger, who go to church and give no further cause for complaint. It is precisely that human aspect that doesn&#x27;t fit with the story Americans had woven for themselves, which frightens them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I was left to wonder, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; would one be frightened of sincerely good people? Is it the confrontation with one&#x27;s own faulty assumptions of the world that is frightening? But then those Negroes that live positive lives are not the frightening factor, but rather it is an inner demon housed in Americans that fuels their fright. Any human would benefit from acknowledging their own wrongs, incorrect assumptions, and mistakes on a regular basis. Population-wide individual introspection seems to have never really been reached, maybe because it is too difficult of an exercise for many. How to increase the practice of effective introspection?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the essay, James writes a very powerful story as he would have liked to see &lt;em&gt;Native son&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; go, but ends with the conclusion that the actual novel ends on a much more underwhelming note.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;carmen-jones-the-dark-is-light-enough&quot;&gt;Carmen Jones: The dark is light enough&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James critiques the 1954 film &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carmen_Jones_(film)&quot;&gt;Carmen Jones&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Despite the professional competencies of the cast, James argues, the film never attains any positive qualities. The screenplay, the shots, and the musical score all distinctly did not fit the Negro actors. They muddled the plausibility of the Negro population.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, James argues that the director leans too heavily into the sexual connotation society places with dark-skinned bodies. The lead actress Dorothy Dandridge is put to flounce around in tight skirts and plunging necklines—which James remarks to not exactly be plausible sexuality either. However, the male lead Harry Belafonte isn&#x27;t allowed any sexuality in his role. The Negro male is too loaded a quantity for the director to know quite how to handle. Thus his sexuality is simply assumed, per extension of the societal image of the Negro male derived from statistical myths. Bosley Crowther from The New York Times presented similar critiques in his &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1954&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;archives&#x2F;updated-translation-of-bizet-work-bows.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Baldwin concludes with the following paragraph.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing about this movie—and the reason that, despite itself, it is one of the most important all-Negro movies Hollywood has yet produced—is that the questions it leaves in the mind relate less to Negroes than to the interior life of Americans. One wonders, it is true, if Negroes are really going to become the ciphers this movie makes them out to be; but, since they have until now survived public images even more appalling, one is encouraged to hope, for their sake and the sake of the Republic, that they will continue to prove themselves incorrigible. Besides, life does not produce ciphers like these: when people have become this empty they are not ciphers any longer, but monsters. The creation of such ciphers proves, however, that Americans are far from empty; they are, on the contrary, very deeply disturbed. And this disturbance is not the kind which can be eased by the doing of good works, but seems to have turned inward and shows every sign of becoming personal. This is one of the best things that can possibly happen. It can be taken to mean—among a great many other things—that the ferment which has resulted in as odd a brew as Carmen Jones can now be expected to produce something which will be more bitter on the tongue but sweeter in the stomach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-harlem-ghetto&quot;&gt;The Harlem ghetto&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin poses that Negroes bolster serious contempt against Jews, despite them all being part of a society that marginalizes both of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in Harlem irreparably scars Negro youth. The wonder is not that so many are ruined, but that so many survive. Negro news outlets are constricted, and mimic White institutions. If anything, Negro outlets are more sensational.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-of-a-native-son&quot;&gt;Notes of a native son&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&#x27;s father was psychologically scarred, had anger issues, and was extremely suspicious of other people. James had always despised his father because of this, until he lived his first year on his own.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James speaks of the sheer weight that presses on him, and all other Negroes in America, by the silent societal injustices. This oppressive weight, spread out over a whole life, may build up to sudden bursts of anger. He tells of his father, and how he despised him, but near the end we see James&#x27;s development leading him to understand that his own story is very similar to his father&#x27;s.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounter-on-the-seine-black-meets-brown&quot;&gt;Encounter on the Seine: Black meets Brown&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonial French Africans that James Brown meets in Paris, lead him to think about their differences from Negroes, or African Americans. I think this is best captured in the following quote.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African before him has endured privation, injustice, medieval cruelty; but the African has not yet endured the utter alienation of himself from his people and his past. His mother did not sing “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,” and he has not, all his life long, ached for acceptance in a culture which pronounced straight hair and white skin the only acceptable beauty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-question-of-identity&quot;&gt;A question of identity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James ponders on the American student identity in Paris. A most striking quote I found to be the following.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] the American wishes to be liked &lt;em&gt;as a person&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, an implied distinction which makes perfect sense to him, and none whatever to the European. What the American means is that he does not want to be confused with the Marshall Plan, Hollywood, the Yankee dollar, television, or Senator McCarthy. What the European, in a thoroughly exasperating innocence, assumes is that the American cannot, of course, be divorced from the so diverse phenomena which make up his country, and that he is willing, and able, to clarify the American conundrum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading this, I thought that James was setting up a nice argument of hypocrisy. Namely, that Americans, once they go abroad and are strangers themselves, personally do not enjoy being stereotyped and identified based on certain characteristics of their group. However, back home, this is precisely what they have been inflicting on the Negro population; not appreciating Negroes as individual human beings, but rather judging them based on the abstract societal narrative woven around the Afro-American population. Ultimately, the feelings James thus observed with the American students abroad, would be a great showing of hypocrisy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, that is not where James guided his essay to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;equal-in-paris&quot;&gt;Equal in Paris&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James tells about the time he is arrested and spends more than a week in jail while in Paris, only because a friend of him stole some bedsheets from a hotel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was chilled by their merriment, even though it was meant to warm me. It could only remind me of the laughter I had often heard at home, laughter which I had sometimes deliberately elicited. This laughter is the laughter of those who consider themselves to be at a safe remove from all the wretched, for whom the pain of the living is not real.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay evoked a feeling of hopelessness in me. The life James was living in Paris seems so empty, which was partly caused by his introspective tendencies which prevented him from doing much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stranger-in-the-village&quot;&gt;Stranger in the village&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James talks about the times he visited a tiny Swiss village. He argues that these Europeans rightly have no experience with living with Black people. However, Americans are significantly different from Europeans in that they have been living with Afro-Americans for hundreds of years in some way or the other. This makes them all into a different people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, if the American Negro has arrived at his identity by virtue of the absoluteness of his estrangement from his past, American white men still nourish the illusion that there is some means of recovering the European innocence, of returning to a state in which black men do not exist. This is one of the greatest errors Americans can make. The identity they fought so hard to protect has, by virtue of that battle, undergone a change: Americans are as unlike any other white people in the world as it is possible to be. I do not think, for example, that it is too much to suggest that the American vision of the world—which allows so little reality, generally speaking, for any of the darker forces in human life, which tends until today to paint moral issues in glaring black and white—owes a great deal to the battle waged by Americans to maintain between themselves and black men a human separation which could not be bridged. It is only now beginning to be borne in on us—very faintly, it must be admitted, very slowly, and very much against our will—that this vision of the world is dangerously inaccurate, and perfectly useless. For it protects our moral high-mindedness at the terrible expense of weakening our grasp of reality. People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come to realize that the interracial drama acted out on the American continent has not only created a new black man, it has created a new white man, too. No road whatever will lead Americans back to the simplicity of this European village where white men still have the luxury of looking on me as a stranger. I am not, really, a stranger any longer for any American alive. One of the things that distinguishes Americans from other people is that no other people has ever been so deeply involved in the lives of black men, and vice versa. This fact faced, with all its implications, it can be seen that the history of the American Negro problem is not merely shameful, it is also something of an achievement. For even when the worst has been said, it must also be added that the perpetual challenge posed by this problem was always, somehow, perpetually met. It is precisely this black-white experience which may prove of indispensable value to us in the world we face today. This world is white no longer, and it will never be white again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereby ending this essay and the book.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short quote that I found fascinating, also from this essay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are not naturally reflective any more than they are naturally malicious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Living in a single room numbed me down into a mindless being floating through time. Let me explain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been living in single room apartments for almost two years now; the joys of studying abroad in two different countries. These rooms have a distinctly temporary feel to them, and often consist of not much more than a table, a chair, a fridge, and a bed. A small kitchen and bathroom may or may not be included (as in, either they are shared with others in the apartment, or I am living in a tiny studio on my own). In these rooms, I study, work, eat, relax, and sleep. Except for sleeping, this all happens at the same table, whilst sitting in the same chair. There are few physical differences to tell apart the activities with which I fill sixty-seven percent of my days. Watching lectures? I am sitting at the table behind my laptop. Working in my internship? I am sitting at the table behind my laptop. Meeting with my thesis supervisors? Again, I am sitting at the table behind my laptop. Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;Nerdwriter1&quot;&gt;Nerdwriter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on YouTube or reading through blogs and newspapers online? Table, laptop. With so much of my days physically identical to each other, it starts impacting my mental state. The extremely low quantity of new impressions causes my brain to register these days as big blurs. All activities blend into each other, and the days start to blend too. Looking back at periods of multiple months, they don&#x27;t feel to have lasted longer than just a couple of weeks. And this absence of memories is a problem; time for a short interlude on happiness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I was talking with Jack about the pursuit of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Happiness&quot;&gt;happiness&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Arguably, large parts of the world&#x27;s population live their lives seeking happiness. Now, Jack remarked that he thought this was a totally wrong approach to life. The pursuit of happiness is a never-ending journey, he said, there is no point in life at which you can say to have found &lt;em&gt;the&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happiness (although there are these concepts of transcendence, enlightenment, and Nirvana that symbolize this exact moment). Practically, seeking happiness is a fruitless effort. Rather, you should just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happy. But because this also doesn&#x27;t bring us any further, I pressed him on what he thought us mortals should focus our efforts instead. Achieve experiences and create memories, was Jack&#x27;s answer. He further explained, that achievements are things we can concretely work towards, fulfill, and then look back on. After having achieved something, you will never un-achieve it. Unlike the quest for happiness, where one is never sure if it has been reached, is in the now, or has already passed. Living your life working towards meaningful achievements will culminate in you being able to reflect and remember on it all, which has large intrinsic value to many of us. (the point is ultimately that &quot;seeking happiness&quot; is less effective as life advice than &quot;work to achieve things and make memories&quot;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, making memories is a good way to live life. But I also established that I wasn&#x27;t doing a whole lot of that, which is thus pretty bad. And there is an additional aspect that makes it even worse. I talked about the lack of physical diversity in my surroundings as an instigator of this time blur. However, if I dig deeper, I notice that this isn&#x27;t the actual problem. A more specific formulation would instead be &quot;the occupation of my mind&#x27;s attention by activities that do not create meaningful memories&quot;. Reformulating the problem like this, a new perpetrator enters the stage. Distractions. And especially the low-hanging fruit of social media distractions. Let me nuance this a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t say that direct messaging is that bad of a deal; it still builds up a form of connection between actual human beings. Instead, I want to mostly take aim at &lt;em&gt;infinite feed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; parts of media consumption. For me, this includes stuff like Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and YouTube. My use of the former few is not all that excessive; between zero and three hours per day. YouTube would most often be the bigger distraction to me. But I can just as easily be distracted by interesting blog posts, Wikipedia articles, or random web rabbit holes. The main effect of all of these, is that time just speeds past. All the while, I am practically not challenging any active part of my mind. No creativity, no reflection; no thinking. This is ultimately what then keeps my mind occupied for large amounts of time in a day, because of its comforting call that is so easily answered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes one into a mindless being. Becoming too comfortable in the eternal cycle of short-term gratifications that forgo any meaning on a human timescale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Except that watching and reading certain stuff can actually teach you lots of useful things too! The point is that one just needs to start creating something by oneself to really feel the payoff and satisfaction of learning.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to remedy free time? This evening I came home after having spent the day working on my Master&#x27;s thesis at campus. I prepared fresh pita bread with a spicy chili, and purposefully ate it while standing in my kitchen. Just doing that single thing. Sensing joy for every individual bite I took. I cleaned up and walked back to my room, where I sat on my bed and just fathomed how good it made me feel to focus my attention on a single action. Still sitting on my mattress, I grabbed a paper notebook and started jotting down some thoughts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the lesson here? It seems to me that purposeful attention makes any activity more meaningful. And I do not mean to advocate for a western Zen philosophy here. I purely recognize this on an individual and personal level as something that makes me feel better about what I do. It also inspires me to think more about what I want to spend my limited time here at earth on. This ultimately nudges me more towards activities that actually make meaningful memories in my brain; arguably leading to a more fulfilled life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to rhyme this with the psychological concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flow_(psychology)&quot;&gt;flow states&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? These seem to be periods of time in which everything &lt;em&gt;flows&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and only hours later you rediscover your conscious self again. Does this oppose the purposeful attention I wrote about earlier? Maybe not. The flow state might actually be seen as an ultimate form of purposeful attention on a single activity you are performing. So much so, that you don&#x27;t waste any of your finite attention span on anything outside of it. A beautiful endeavor to aspire to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;My semester of exchange experience in Stockholm was backdropped by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Luckily, the Swedish approach allowed me plenty of freedom.
Even though there were no lectures on campus, I was able to visit museums, restaurants, and generally walk through the beautiful city.
I had picked up a new camera, and Stockholm proved to be a fantastic place for developing my street photography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a small selection of twelve images I took during my time in Stockholm, to form a short, narrative introduction to how I have experienced the largest Nordic city.
I will offer some words in between, to expand on the mood or happenings of an image.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f003.backblazeb2.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;maxcrone-org&#x2F;img&#x2F;2020-10-04-stockholm_1280.avif&quot; type=&quot;image&#x2F;avif&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f003.backblazeb2.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;maxcrone-org&#x2F;img&#x2F;2020-10-04-stockholm_1280.webp&quot; type=&quot;image&#x2F;webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f003.backblazeb2.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;maxcrone-org&#x2F;img&#x2F;2020-10-04-stockholm_1280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Day view of Stockholm on one of my walks.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Day view of Stockholm on one of my walks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might actually be my favorite image of Stockholm.
The street view it presents through a blurry facade of greenery speaks precisely to how I experienced the city.
The buildings, their roofs — matte and colored, the broad and impeccable roads.
Shortly after arriving in Sweden, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kiki&amp;#x27;s_Delivery_Service&quot;&gt;Kiki&#x27;s delivery service&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Miyazaki, in which the city is modeled after Stockholm.
Ever since, any sight of Stockholm gave me the magical Ghibli sentiments.
But this image exemplifies that the best for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f003.backblazeb2.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;maxcrone-org&#x2F;img&#x2F;2020-08-30-kungsträdgården_1280.avif&quot; type=&quot;image&#x2F;avif&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;picture&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Late summer view of Kungsträdgården in the city centre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the pandemic, the people of Stockholm didn&#x27;t leave the streets to be post-apocalyptic wastelands, like in so many other cities around the world.
Especially during late summer, this provided me with ample opportunity to practice street photography.
I have been building up courage in photographing people on the streets, and ultimately also taking portraits of them.
The following three pictures form a small &quot;people of Stockholm&quot; sub-collection.
There are, however, many and many more pictures I took of people.
I might publish them some time in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nordic winters are extremely understimulating when there isn&#x27;t any snow to be seen yet.
The days become a gray blur, and darkness becomes increasingly insistent.
The nights then start to become a more interesting playing field — especially in a larger city such as Stockholm, with its many lamps and leds — because of the contrasts between light and darkness.
There were plenty of nights where I went out to peacefully walk and observe.
The following three images provide a small glimpse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;picture-subscript&quot;&gt;Talking with friends in front of my apartment building.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last three pictures sum up the meditative simplicities of life that I learned to appreciate more, in keeping my sanity during the pandemic-riddled semester.
Ultimately, talking and working with friends makes my life fulfilling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://maxcrone.org/essay/coomaraswamy-and-art/">
            
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Als antwoord op een vriendin, nadat ze een conversatie stuurde van een jongen die twee citaten van Coomaraswamy aanhaalde, gerelateerd aan &quot;art that&#x27;s universal&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ik kan me wel vinden in het sentiment dat de huidige Westerse maatschappij nou bepaald niet stimulerend of motiverend is voor kunstenaars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maar ik moet tegelijkertijd ook wel denken aan een nuance op het geromantiseerde beeld van de pre-koloniale en pre-renaissance samenlevingen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want wie was die &quot;artist who is robbed of his art&quot; in dit verhaal? Waren dit niet vaak gewone mensen die beelden bijtelden, potten maakten en versierden, weefpatronen ontwikkelden, persoonlijke ornamenten creëerden en droegen, of in bepaalde architecturele stijlen bouwden? Ik heb eigenlijk het idee dat het concept &quot;kunstenaar&quot; pas echt concrete vorm kreeg in relatief moderne tijden. In middeleeuws en jonger Europa was kunst meer een communal aangelegenheid; minder focus op de individuele kunstenaar, en meer focus op het werk of de thematiek. En daarnaast, wie hadden er nou echt de vrijheid om hun leven toe te wijden aan het ontwikkelen van kunst? In klassiek Griekenland bestond een groot deel van de bevolking uit slaven. Nagenoeg geen enkele vrouw komt voor in de lijsten met kunstenaars uit die tijd. In de middeleeuwen was nagenoeg de hele Europese bevolking meer bezig met in leven trachten te blijven, voor zover dat ging, dan met iets anders. In vergelijking met toen, heeft in onze samenleving nu toch relatief wel een groter deel van de bevolking de piramide van Mavlov bestegen. Is dat niet juist een mooiere en vruchtbaardere grond voor diverser werk? Een verschil is dat kunst nu een minder grote rol speelt in de samenleving, omdat het niet langer de enige effectieve vorm van massacommunicatie is. Maar er wordt nog steeds ontzettend veel kunst gemaakt. De jaren tachtig werden geroemd vanwege de kunstenaarscommunities in Amsterdam en Berlijn, en nu zeggen we ook weer dat dat allemaal verloren is gegaan. Feit lijkt te zijn dat de vorm waarin kunst geschapen wordt constant aan verandering onderhevig is. De doelstellingen van kunst verschuiven.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coomaraswamy was fan van traditionele symboliek, en hij had een fantastisch overzicht van hoe mensen dit gebruikten in vroegere tijden om ideeën over te brengen en te preserveren toen het schrift nog onderontwikkeld was. We zijn nu verder. Misschien heeft juist de overvloed aan manieren om te communiceren wel geleid tot minder doordachte en kunstwaardige boodschappen. Maar temidden van alle noise, zijn er nog steeds mensen die nadenken over wat ze maken, en hoe ze op nieuwe en unieke manieren de wereld kunnen duiden. In mijn ogen is het speelveld voor kunstenaars juist egaler geworden, nog niet perfect obviously, maar een verbetering ten opzichte van duizenden jaren geleden. Er zijn meer mogeiljkheden, meer vormen van expressie, meer toegang tot kunst, meer inspiratie, een groter bereik.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ik ben het wel sterk eens met de zorgen over de vervanging van vocation door profession. Maar opnieuw is dit eigenlijk niet anders dan vroeger. Een hele kleine minderheid van de bevolking was verbonden aan guilds of andere craftmanshipverbanden.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; Wat betekent dat een meerderheid van de bevolking waarschijnlijk veelal werk deed als &quot;profession&quot;.  Farmers, gardeners, wine-growers, shepherds, miners, or fishermen. Desondanks denk ik dat onze samenleving wel echt een stuk mooier zou worden als we ons meer gingen richten op vocation. Misschien dat een toenemende arbeidsproductiviteit in de toekomst deze keer wel zorgt voor meer vrije tijd voor de mens om na te streven wat ons echt een betekenisvol gevoel geeft. En op dat punt zal onze kunst er ook weer heel anders uit zien.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese cuisine has developed itself according to &lt;strong&gt;Eight Great Traditions&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (八大菜系, Bā Dà Cài Xì) , related to different regional cultures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making satisfying photos of food is so much harder when it is already dark outside since three in the afternoon.
And when the dish I am making isn&#x27;t particularly photogenic, I end up with a picture like the one above.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, let&#x27;s talk actual cooking.
Mapo tofu is a popular Chinese dish from the Sichuan province.
The tofu is set in a spicy, thin sauce based on a fermented broad bean and chili paste (doubanjiang) and fermented black beans (douchi), with some additional minced beef.
One of the food blogs I follow is aptly title &lt;em&gt;China Sichuan Food&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Two days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chinasichuanfood.com&#x2F;mapo-tofu-recipe&#x2F;&quot;&gt;their post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on mapo tofu reached my feed reader, which was my main inspiration for this dish.
And of course, I also quickly read through the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mapo_tofu&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to establish a broader understanding on the history of the dish.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by boiling diced soft tofu in lightly salted water.
Carefully get it out. We don&#x27;t want to dice it up any further.
Proceed by frying up the minced meat in some oil until it gets crispy.
Take it out and drop a tablespoon of doubanjiang in the pan.
Lightly whisk it through the oil, until everything has a pleasantly red color.
I then added some fermented black bean &lt;em&gt;sauce&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, instead of just the beans themselves, because that was what I still had standing in my fridge.
At this point, also add chopped garlic, ginger, and scallion.
It is aroma time, so stir around some more until it comfortably wafts through your kitchen.
Now add some water (I added somewhere around 400 milliliters), a tablespoon of light soy sauce, some sugar, and half of our cooked meat.
Let everything simmer for three minutes or so.
Now carefully slide in our tofu and let everything simmer for another eight to ten minutes.
In a separate glass or bowl, mix a tablespoon of cornstarch with two-and-a-half tablespoons of water.
After our sauce has simmered for a while, stir in half of our starch mixture, wait half a minute, and stir in the rest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, mapo tofu is served in a visually pleasing bowl, with a bowl of steamed rice on the side.
I had my bowl of rice ready and instead ladled the sauce on top directly from the pan.
Keep in mind that this dish is supposed to have a numbing sensation of heat and cook accordingly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just returned from a walk around campus. No camera, no phone. Only me, my jacket, and my keys. It was dark and quiet outside, but the temperature was nice. Around nine degrees. Before starting my walk, I felt empty. I had sat inside all day, working and procrastinating. Once outside, I relished the fresh air, and I decided I would do some urban exploring. Right next to my apartment building, there is another building that has an elevated terrace attached to it. After walking up to the metal stairs connecting it to my level, I tested the strength of the supports, and confirming its durability I pulled myself up and squirmed through the gap between the stairs and the handles. Voila, I had made it onto the elevated terrace, urban exploration style. Right next to the terrace, there was a small “roof” lined with a metal fence, shielding from stairs that lead down. I jumped on the fence and made my way parallel to the stairs across the roof. There was a gate in the middle. I sat on one side of it, and thought to myself that it would be a cool challenge to make it to the other side of the gate without touching the ground. And so I swung myself from one gate fence to the other, to ultimately make my way to the opposite side of the gate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued my walk across the campus. Past desolate offices of researchers. Glancing in, I could distill the personal stories of the people working there all day. If an office didn’t have pictures of children hanging above a desk, then I could be sure that there were pictures of cats hanging in their place. I got to the side of the library, and standing on a fence I found a beautiful angle for photography. Nothing much happened there, but I am writing it as a reminder to myself to bring my camera there sometime in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopping down some dark stairs brought me to the backside of a restaurant on campus. A small truck was parked next to a back entrance for supplying ingredients et al. The space for the truck was tight; buildings loomed close on three sides. On the side of one of them, there hang an awfullly steep emergency staircase. I climbed my way up and marveled for some time at the completely new perspective it gave me on the campus. Looking over to the truck, I realized how close it actually was. If I wanted to, I could easily hop onto its roof. Now that I thought of it, why &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I want to quickly stand on top of a truck? Haven’t done it before, and a much better opportunity couldn’t possibly exist. Now of course, there is no real added value in standing on top of a truck. Besides the slight thrill of it. Heck, I made the jump. The suspensions of the vehicle made for some good fun when I moved from side to side, or when I wobbled a bit. No one passed by while I was standing on top of that truck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After jumping down, my walk brought me to the building of the faculty of architecture. Coming from the direction of the computer science student club, I thought to myself what a cool photo it must be when looking at the lights on the top floor of the architecture building in its dark surroundings. I should bring my camera there sometime too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my way over to the classic campus courtyard, looking for interesting structures to climb. There aren’t many, sadly. Going to the upper courtyard, I found some interesting office spaces that I want to photograph through the windows. Maybe make it into a series; researchers in their office, as seen through the outside window. I could rent a lift and make my way past all the windows of the high buildings. I also shared a weird look with two girls studying inside an empty hall there. I made my way down to the main courtyard again, and walked to a staircase that is flanked on both sides by a small wall with large gaps in it. The “windowsill” of those gaps is slanted, but wide enough to sit on. Actually, it is also wide enough to lie down on. And so I lay there for ten to fifteen minutes. Thinking about things. Also realizing how liberating it is to go out without any phone or other distractions. It really allowed me to experience the world with genuine curiosity again. I got some ideas for subjects I would like to research and write about. One person passed me by to go inside the building. I didn’t meet their eyes, but they must have wondered why I was just lying there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up, jumped off on the other side, and returned home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;h2 id=&quot;jollof-rice-obe-ata-braised-chicken-thigh&quot;&gt;Jollof rice, obe ata, braised chicken thigh&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020-9-27&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jollof rice was based on an article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;1020288-jollof-rice&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; written by Yewande Komolafe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obe ata (spicy Nigerian red pepper sauce) used habanero&#x27;s, which gave it plenty of heat while it became surprisingly flavorful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used chicken thigh, but Yewande actually suggested braised goat. A cut of meat that lends itself better to braising would be great here, because the chicken thigh was not spectacular.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fried-plantains-with-ewa-riso-and-rice&quot;&gt;Fried plantains with ewa riso and rice&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020-10-12&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plantains were not ripe enough. They had too many yellow, even greenish, patches, while for frying you&#x27;d ideally have very ripe ones. This is according to Jasmine&#x27;s mother, who originates from Ghana and makes lots of fried plantain dishes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ewa riro (or &quot;stewed beans&quot;) were based on a recipe from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheflolaskitchen.com&#x2F;ewa-riro-stewed-beans-2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Lola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I bought shrimp powder for this, which lends it a very unique flavor bursting with umami. Although I did feel that I shouldn&#x27;t eat too much of it then, because at some point I started to dislike that specific taste.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Flyn docked his airpod with a soft thud in the harbor of this planet’s only settlement. There was nothing special about the location. This place was as barren, rocky and hilly as the rest of the planet. Instead, the company’s artificial agents deemed a single settlement optimal in their pursuit for profits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn stood up and left the cockpit. He liked to fly the airpod himself, which his ship’s AI found terribly frustrating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I consider it important to bring under your attention,” his ship said, “that by letting me pilot your airpod, it will take you a thousand years longer to die from a traffic accident. I can present you with the statistical evidence if you are not yet convinced by my clearly superior argument.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is the use of another thousand if my infallible piloting skills only become slightly less infallible once every five hundred years?” Flyn countered. “Besides, I only have a hundred and fifty years to live.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a lack of statistical evidence to support your claim,” his ship began.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shush!”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn walked along and went looking for Qula. Qula was a mercenary security expert, a pentester gone rogue or whatever you would like to call her. Technicalities aside, she was quite the capable young lady, helping him to smuggle his first harvest of keys off this planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found her sitting in the lounge. Spread before her on the table were multiple devices allowing her to interface with his ship. Flyn had always talked to his ships, but she had told him that was too slow and unreliable of a method for her activities. She felt more comfortable when reading and typing. Weird girl.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have docked. An artificial customs officer will soon be assigned to our cargo.” Flyn said.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qula answered, “I know.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have done this before, right?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course I have. Besides, there is no use in worrying. These AIs are relatively young, thus deep bribing them is easier. Their patterns are not as strongly reinforced yet. Therefore they are more likely to accept other inputs.” Qula’s voice sounded calm, but her fingers were restless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn nodded and moved to settle on one of the couches in the lounge. From a small side table he picked up his pipe and retrieved a key from a box next to it. Of course these were not from his own stash of keys. Never consume what you produce yourself. Rather, this one originated from a high quality producer closer to the center of the universe. They were expensive, but the taste was amazing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn stuffed his pipe with the key, triggering the treasured sensations. The key dissolved and became the fuel. Flyn sighed a long and relaxed sigh. He tapped his earpiece and requested his ship to keep him updated about the proceedings privately instead of shouting it through the whole room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship began expressing his totally neutral observations, “she is good! The artificial customs officer assigned to our cargo has already fallen for her deep bribe. We have been allocated two freighters. Drones have already started unloading the crates. Qula gave them limited permissions to be able to do their work.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn smiled approvingly. She was indeed worth the hefty sum of money she charged. He saw opportunities on this planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qula jumped up and spoke before even the ship could warn him, “Flyn! We have a problem! The drones have loaded your ship.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why? I do not have any other contracts here. What did they load?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cargo space has been filled with explosives!”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being partially high from smoking keys, Flyn did not fully comprehend the seriousness of his oncoming death. At first. But when Qula no longer bothered with her devices and instead had stood up to – believe it or not – walk towards him, he understood that their situation was somewhat dire. Why else would she find it necessary to use her physical presence to emphasize her communicational interaction? Admittedly, her physical presence was quite charming, so his mind decided that maybe he should indeed worry about this situation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn sprang up from the couch and checked in with his ship, “can you tell me more about the explosives?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ship said, “Actually, the situation is under control. The explosives are in no danger of being set off.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn sighed then, not one of his relaxed sighs, but still a sigh of relief. Qula however raised her eyebrows upon hearing the declaration of temporal safety by the ship.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flyn, it is not..” began Qula, but the ship interrupted her.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have learned it to be important to comfort human beings in stressful situations like these. Therefore, allow me to tell you a joke. I promise you this one will be so good you will feel exceptionally comforted afterwards.” If the ship would have had a face, you could have seen it gleaming from satisfaction. It continued, “What do you call a blonde who dyed her hair brown?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at Qula, Flyn found her to be looking as dumbfounded as he was feeling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Artificial intelligence!” pronounced the ship with a hint of pride in his otherwise perfectively objective simulation of a voice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn smiled at the ill-timed sillyness of the joke. But Qula snatched her devices from the table and headed towards the exit doors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where are you going?” Flyn asked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your ship is lying to you, “ she answered, “the explosives are about to blow any moment.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean? It declared the situation to be safe.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I repeat. Your ship is lying.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impossible! For that the AI would have to be compromised and there is no entity present on this planet who is computationally advanced enough to pull that off.” Although he believed in what he said, Flyn started feeling uncomfortable. After all, Qula had been monitoring the cargo space and would therefore know what was going on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not just stand there,” Qula said while going through the opening sequence for the doors, “run!”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn did what she told him and bolted through the door after her when she got it open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No! Do not leave me behind!” his ship pleaded. “Do not go with her.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made Flyn stop. Was he about to just run off, away from his ship? With only the words of a mercenary girl against those of his ship? There had been something weird in the way it had acted though. And heck, if the ship was right and it would not explode, there was also no harm in being away for a second. Flyn slipped through the doors out of the dock after Qula, which closed behind him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ship exploded.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singeing nearly reached them via visual sight alone. Flyn’s everything was wet from sweat. Both he and Qula lay slumped against the outside wall of the dock.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I should have seen it sooner. It was supposed to keep us on there until it exploded,” Qula said, “I guess the company is not that indifferent to freeloaders exploiting their optioned planet after all.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyn suppressed his emotions. They could be dealt with later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qula beckoned him, “Follow me, I have some plans.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-footer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This piece was written as part of a writing contest with friends, which we call Escape. It is great fun!
Every round, the participants write a story that incorporates a situation from which to escape.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, we all submit our part anonymously and the voting phase begins.
We read the stories and give points to the ones we like most.
The piece with the most votes wins and will from there on out be an official installment in the story chain.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, the next round proceeds similarly, except that everyone writes a sequel to the winning story of the previous round in which they solve the posed problem.
This goes on as long as we want. This story actually consists of my entries to two subsequent rounds.
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
