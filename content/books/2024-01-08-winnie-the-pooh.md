Cute and silly adventures that have aged pretty well, to be honest.
Though there is something odd about this book.
<!-- more -->
Winnie-the-Pooh has a somewhat awkward sense of self-deprecation.
To a degree that feels almost insulting to the poor bear.
Many of the other characters also show depressive or fatalistic tendencies.

But ultimately, all the logical fallacies that the forest animals spew, make the book quite endearing.
It's rather refreshing to read something that is purposefully not optimized for believability.
Here we are, just reading about silly adventures with goofy animals.
