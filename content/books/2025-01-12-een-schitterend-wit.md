A stream of consciousness that made me feel like I'm close to death myself.

Is this how internal monologues work for people?
The prose is as if we're tapping directly into a person's thoughts.
He's thinking the same fact or observation multiple times in a row, but slightly altered every iteration, so that it slowly builds up until he has changed his mind (or worsened the idea in his head).

Or is this an example of the mental fog people would experience as they get older and their body starts to give up?

I did not feel particularly invested in this man's fate.
His mental clumsiness put me off from that.
But I did pity him for having to wade through his own thoughts.

Translated in English as "A Shining".
I read the Dutch translation.
