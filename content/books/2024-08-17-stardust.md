Quirky neo-myth that keeps on tumbling before you can ask questions.
Not a children's book, but definitely lends heavily from their type of fun.

When I read [The Graveyard Book](/books/graveyard-book) by Neil some time ago, I mostly thought how much fun it'd have been if I read it when I was a child.
But *Stardust* was just as much fun to read as an adult as I'd imagine it is as a child, if not more so!

When I tried to explain the plot to my friends, I tumbled from one bizarity into the next, starting to realize that the plot was absolutely bonkers.
It sounds like a psychedelic dream when you explain it out loud.
But Neil does this so well!

Halfway through the story I started to get slightly bored of the faery world, but Neil turns around and manages to resolve all of the threads he's artfully started throughout the book.
Managing to keep me thoroughly engaged until the end and *past* it.
