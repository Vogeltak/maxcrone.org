description = "With tropical rainstorms looming in Tokyo, I'd bought a few onigiri from a convenience store to eat in a secluded alley to fuel up for more photography. This man came walking by with his dog that didn't feel like continuing any longer. They settled near the stairs, and the dog took the opportunity for a big stretch."
