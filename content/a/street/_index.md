Street photography from places I've lived in (a.o., Amsterdam, Helsinki, \
Stockholm). But also from any other places I've visited over the years. \
This might be my favorite genre of photography overall. I love walking \
around in centres of human civilizations with a cute little purpose of \
observing the interesting things happening around me. \
