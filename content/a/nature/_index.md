Both in The Netherlands (bogs, dunes) and outside. Nature is a genre that \
I have relatively little experience in. Most shots are from moments where I \
was out with friends or family and thought to bring a camera along. But \
I'm thinking about doing trips more focused on photograps; optimizing for \
time of day, light, and weather conditions. \
