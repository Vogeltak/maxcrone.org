My semester of exchange experience in Stockholm was backdropped by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Luckily, the Swedish approach allowed me plenty of freedom.
Even though there were no lectures on campus, I was able to visit museums, restaurants, and generally walk through the beautiful city.
I had picked up a new camera, and Stockholm proved to be a fantastic place for developing my street photography.

The following is a small selection of twelve images I took during my time in Stockholm, to form a short, narrative introduction to how I have experienced the largest Nordic city.
I will offer some words in between, to expand on the mood or happenings of an image.

This might actually be my favorite image of Stockholm.
The street view it presents through a blurry facade of greenery speaks precisely to how I experienced the city.
The buildings, their roofs — matte and colored, the broad and impeccable roads.
Shortly after arriving in Sweden, I watched [Kiki's delivery service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki's_Delivery_Service) by Miyazaki, in which the city is modeled after Stockholm.
Ever since, any sight of Stockholm gave me the magical Ghibli sentiments.
But this image exemplifies that the best for me.

Despite the pandemic, the people of Stockholm didn't leave the streets to be post-apocalyptic wastelands, like in so many other cities around the world.
Especially during late summer, this provided me with ample opportunity to practice street photography.
I have been building up courage in photographing people on the streets, and ultimately also taking portraits of them.
The following three pictures form a small "people of Stockholm" sub-collection.
There are, however, many and many more pictures I took of people.
I might publish them some time in the future.

Nordic winters are extremely understimulating when there isn't any snow to be seen yet.
The days become a gray blur, and darkness becomes increasingly insistent.
The nights then start to become a more interesting playing field — especially in a larger city such as Stockholm, with its many lamps and leds — because of the contrasts between light and darkness.
There were plenty of nights where I went out to peacefully walk and observe.
The following three images provide a small glimpse.

{{ image(name="2020-11-14-cinema", size="1280", caption="The oldest film house in Stockholm, where I went for showings during the Stockholm film festival.") }}

{{ image(name="2020-10-25-forest", size="1280", caption="Mystical Nordic forests just north of campus.") }}

{{ image(name="2020-11-23-room", size="1280", caption="The room in which I have been working all semester long, during one of the beautiful sunsets.") }}

{{ image(name="2020-12-09-friends", size="1280", caption="Talking with friends in front of my apartment building.") }}

The last three pictures sum up the meditative simplicities of life that I learned to appreciate more, in keeping my sanity during the pandemic-riddled semester.
Ultimately, talking and working with friends makes my life fulfilling.
