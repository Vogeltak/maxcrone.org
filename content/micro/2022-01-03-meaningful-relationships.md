Do we confuse "deep" conversations with meaningful relationships? Why does it sometimes feel more meaningful to be talking *about* a relationship instead of experiencing things together? I'm guessing it is partly a matter of conscious attention given to the moment (i.e., talking about a relationship forces one to really consciously reflect on the inter-human connection)..
