Nina Menkes's *Brainwashed: sex-camera-power* does it all.
It serves both as a masterfully articulated indictment of the patriarchal and propagandist status quo and as an inspiring anthology of post-patriarchal cinema.
Nina incites within us a yearning for ambiguous excitement and significance far beyond the male gaze.
Here's to the hope that we can transcend the shallow male-centricity of cinema and actually explore the richness of humanity.
