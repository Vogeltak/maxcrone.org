Dan Luu OCR'ed texts between Elon Musk and others, originating from exhibits in the Twitter v. Musk case.
And [published them on his website](https://danluu.com/elon-twitter-texts/) in clear text.

These make for a fascinating insight into personal communication between high-profile business people and investors.
All of these rich people appear to be sucking up to Elon, or otherwise being very careful not to offend him in any way.
Meanwhile Elon is just talking to them all rather brusquely; makes for quite a funny read.
