Watching NVIDIA's GTC keynote, and realizing that these graphic cards have become so powerful that they are bottlenecked by the rate at which NICs can ingest data. This in turn is bottlenecked by the CPU. Thus the solution is to forego the conventional method entirely and just DMA it from the NIC right into the GPU. Crazy.
