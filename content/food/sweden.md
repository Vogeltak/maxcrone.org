## Kanelbulle

I normally don't bake, but Noemi sometimes ropes me into projects that she is making.
These bring me back to my time in Sweden and Finland, where walking through streets and glancing at caf√© windows will always reward you with the sight of beautiful kanelbullar.
Something something *fika*.
Sure.

I cannot exactly recall which recipe we used, but there must be plenty around anyway.
The interesting thing to note, is that you roll out your dough to a rectangular slab and then spread the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top.
Next, you roll it all up, and cut slices from it.
This gives you nice rounds like we had.
Of course, if you want to get a little more fancy, you can cut the dough into strips and braid them into shapes.

Bake, then serve with a good cup of black coffee.
No icing allowed.
