## Sabich

Much more common is the falafel pita.
It is admittedly extremely delicious, *if* you have some good falafel at least.
But another popular streetfood dish in Israel is this pita stuffed with fried aubergine.
Also see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabich).

Prepare your aubergine (or eggplant, if you prefer) first.
Either create long slices, smaller cubes, or whatever tickles your inner sculptist that day.
Liberally salt the aubergine pieces on all sides and let sit for at least half an hour.
Make sure that the liquid can escape; use paper towels or a colander.

Fry them in small batches.
Make sure not to put them into the oil before it is absolutely bubbling (otherwise they might soak up more grease than we'd like).
And fry them just a *tad* darker than you feel comfortable with.

Sabich tastes best with freshly made pita breads.
Use the baker's percentages from my musings on [Menemen](/food/turkey#menemen).
Take care to work the dough powerfully for ten minutes.

For the tahini dressing, whisk with lemon juice.

Feel free to fill the pita with whatever you enjoy.
I love onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes, preferably pickled.
A quick brine consists of 1:1 water:vinegar, with sugar, salt, black pepper.
Bring to a boil and dissolve the sugar.
Pour over your vegetables and leave to cool in the molecule decelerator.

Garnish with parsley and some fermented hot sauce if you like the spice.
