## Gazpacho

{{ image(name="2022-04-25-gazpacho", size="1280", caption="Gazpacho in my mother's garden in Tilburg, 2022.") }}

Simple and refreshing dish. See [Kenji's excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD3WyeqCDHw&t=1s) and the [NYT's recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017577-best-gazpacho).

Blend tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, onion, garlic (we made a version without bread). Add olive oil and red wine vinegar (or any vinegar of your choice; e.g., we used lime juice). Pour in more olive oil while you go.

Traditionally, you would smash up garlic, salt, and bread in a mortar and pestle until it emulsifies. Now that I have one, I would like to try this method some time.
