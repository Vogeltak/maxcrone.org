## Sada roti with vegan curries

{{ image(name="2022-02-08-roti-curry", size="1280", caption="Simple Caribbean roti with three types of curries, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022.") }}

Many Caribbean islands have an incredibly varied population distribution, owing to their immigration/enslavement/exploitation history. Obviously, [roti was introduced here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti#Caribbean) by people from the Indian subcontinent. Even more so, it is often acccompanied by different curries that carry deep historical roots back to many Indian dishes. Very promising.

For today, I opted for the simplest, plain sada roti. For other Caribbean countries, I will later be exploring the much more interesting and challenging Dhalpuri (roti stuffed with split peas or potatoes), which also forms the basis for the [wrap roti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti_(wrap)).

Combine flour, water (50%), salt (1-2%), baking powder (1-2%). Let rest for at least thirty minutes. Roll out to discs, put on a heated [tavah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tava) (or something that resembles it functionally enough) and pour some oil on top of the bread. When the bottom is done, flip around and fry the greased side. Cut into quarts for serving.

Let me quickly list the curries or side dishes I made:

1. Pumpkin with curry spice mix, tomato paste and garlic
2. Chickpea curry with cumin, garlic, and spicy chilies
3. Long beans with white cabbage in kecap manis
