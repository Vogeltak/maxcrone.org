        I've been lucky enough to travel a bit.
        A beautiful way to remember these places is to record small soundscapes.
        They give me one of the strongest cocktails of nostalgia and memories.
        And who doesn't like a map with pins!

            <h3>The city garden</h3>
            <p><i>Recorded on March 27, 2025</i></p>
            <p>I was attending Real World Crypto in the city (amazing conference with many smart people).
And this park happened to become our anchor point around which several activities revolved.
Just after arriving I sat down here for a while on my quick photo walk.
At the end of the first day we gathered in this park with a small group of cryptographers to discuss
ways in which we are able to help our communities in these times.
And later in the week we walked through here a few more times.
After the conference ended, I came here again to decompress a bit.
Locals flocked to the many benches to catch up with friends or colleagues.
Or to just relax in the comfortably warm spring air.

            <p>I had to start my twenty-four hour layover in Singapore with kaya toast.
So I walked to a branch of Ya Kun, already drenched in sweat by the time I got there.
The black coffee, soft boiled eggs, and toast with sweet butter.
Sweltering morning heat and the clatter of plates and retirees catching up with friends.
It promised to be an adventurous day.

            <p><i>Recorded on February 18, 2025</i></p>
            <p>Street food stalls in Singapore have been centralized into big hawker centers.
The much more famous one that appears in most annals of tourism is the Maxwell food centre not too far from here.
I went there first, but it was a weird mix of half tourists and half locals (as far as I am able to tell).
So I continued walking and ran into this one.
Two stories high, full of hawker stalls.
And there it was almost exclusively local office workers on their lunch breaks with colleagues.
Definitely something else than the sad state of office lunch options in the Netherlands.
(Payment options are either cash or one of the 20+ QR codes for different payment apps that I saw plastered onto some stalls.)

            <p>The obligatory cruise through Milford Sound.
This place is purely tourism, but the natural landscape is still stunning.
The drive there was also beautiful, in its early morning light.
It apparently hadn&#x27;t rained for more than six weeks, which is highly unusual for Milford Sound.
But it meant that our boat ride was luxuriously sunny.

            <p><i>Recorded on February 11, 2025</i></p>
            <p>This is a track through some of the rare old-growth bush (this side of New Zealand is mostly one big pasture now).
I&#x27;d camped at the start of the trail, and when I woke up in the morning I was the only one there.
Quick wash in a stream, some sandwiches with peanut butter, camera in the bag and go.
The two waterfalls are roughly halfway along the trail.
Both immensely beautiful and powerful, in the middle of the dense bush.
Have never felt more like an explorer than I felt that morning.

            <p>To get to this remote beach I had to drive along a winding road hugging the mountains on one side
and the water from the bay glistering on the other side (the sun was already setting).
It appeared to mostly be a surfers beach.
The only non-surfer there, was a man with his family, who was carrying fishing cages into the ocean
and reeling them back in a few minutes later, all the while being soaked through.
I walked all the way along the beach until large boulders prevented me from continuing.
There I heard small streams of water rushing down the mountainside, almost as if the stone was weeping.
I spent the remainder of the evening listening to the sea lions and feeling the ocean breeze on my face.
I camped in my van right besides the beach.

            <p><i>Recorded on February  3, 2025</i></p>
            <p>I got lost in the huge but hidden Nicholas building in the middle of Melbourne (look it up on Atlas Obscura).
Every floor was a square circle with old doors behind which should be a multitude of different small businesses and workshops and parlors and clubs.
But I had come at the wrong time of the week.
All the way at the top, I found one door was open.
It led a small art exhibition with a handful of paintings from three different artists.
Stephan McLaughlin has been running that exhibition space for longer than I&#x27;m alive.
And he has stories to tell.
So I just listened while he told, and we gazed through the windows overlooking the city.

            <p>Sitting right besides the great Pacific ocean.
This was a very touristy spot, not only for humans.
Plenty of sea lions and seals chilling on the rocks.
Flocks of seagulls swerving in and out.
I spent the rest of the day reading on the beach, while the sun slowly set and the tide pools filled up
with the water left behind by the retreating ocean.
Richard Powers&#x27;s *Playground* took two characters on a trip to the Scripps institution of oceanography,
only a few kilometers from where I had my bare feet in the sand, and then even to La Jolla itself.
I loved smelling the same air, wading through the same water, and seeing similar small ocean life.
It felt like I was part of the book.

            <p>I was in San Diego the week before for a conference and decided to stay another weekend to explore more of the city.
On the Sunday, I walked over from my hotel in downtown to this traditional Mexican breakfast restaurant.
They serve chilaquiles; basically tortillas simmered in salsa.
I had them with mushrooms, refried beans, and a small tamale on the side.
The restaurant was filled with joyful families and from time to time the staff all came out
making as much noise as they could, rattling and whooping, to celebrate a table.

            <p>I went to volunteer at the Into the Great Wide Open festival on Vlieland.
Worked in the crew kitchen, where we helped to produce breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the thousand people who helped make the festival a reality.
Music is played at different stages in forests and among the dunes.
Locations are beautiful, the people are beautiful, and the island is incredibly peaceful.
The Sunday morning is the end of the festival, when everyone is still reeling from all their experiences but also very, very tired.
We&#x27;re sitting at a small square on the camping, while people are ordering coffee, talking amongst themselves, or quietly listening to some soft music.</p>

We brought sandwiches that we ate on top of a hill, sun blasting, wind lazily throwing us some warm sand.
Talking about pastoral fantasies and nostalgic summer vacations.
After we&#x27;d topped the dunes near the sea, we snoozed on the beach, skinny dipped in the sea, and ate melon while its juice dripped down our faces.</p>

            <p>It was past their flowering, but the plum trees still smelt sweet and dreamy.
Went there on one of my first days and came back again the next week with a friend.</p>

            <p><i>Recorded on May 11, 2024</i></p>
            <p>I had missed the aurora the previous night, but hoped to catch a glimpse of it now, despite rapidly dwindling prospects.
Multiple other people were similarly hopeful and had already settled on the warm sand as the darkness slowly got darker.
Got some nice photos, but no aurora.
Instead, we listened to this frog opera, which was also beautiful, in its own way.</p>

They had a also built a beautiful open shed with a swing next to a pond where the frogs were in mating season.

Or so we thought.
The rain started to fall around us again, but at least we were relatively well protected whilst among the trees.</p>

            <p>My first job out of college had an office in Amsterdam, where they colocated a few racks in the tower&#x27;s basement.
I had to fiddle around in it from time to time when I needed to write integrations with new hardware.</p>
