My truly personal space on the internet.

## What is this about?

I am exploring ways to create and publish more of my own work. This includes writing, photography, software development, and possibly some art projects too.

## How is this built?

This website is built on the well known static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). My pages are in the top-level directory. Posts reside in `_posts`, and my separate collection on cooking is in `_food`.

Most of my writing is done in Markdown files that I either edit with Vim, [Typora](https://typora.io/), or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Future work

- [x] It would be cool to include a dark mode, based on the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
- [x] Separate page for books I have read and reviews I have written
- [ ] Maybe look into the use of Adobe's open-source font family [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Serif), including *Source Sans Pro* and *Source Serif Pro* (also used at [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net))
- [ ] Implement extra tags for posts: `date-started`, `date-updated`, `status`
- [x] Host binary content (i.e., images, documents) on a separate CDN (Backblaze B2)
- [ ] Add social meta tags (twitter, schema, opengraph)
- [ ] Add archive overviews
- [ ] Find a way to incorporate link dumps (I like the idea of small screenshot thumbnails of websites, e.g., see [this](https://www.endriarichardson.com/essays))
