My truly personal space on the internet.

## What is this about?

I am exploring ways to create and publish more of my own work. This includes writing, photography, software development, and possibly some art projects too.

## How is this built?

This website is built on the well known static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). My pages are in the top-level directory. Posts reside in `_posts`, and my separate collection on cooking is in `_food`.

Most of my writing is done in Markdown files that I either edit with Vim, [Typora](https://typora.io/), or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
