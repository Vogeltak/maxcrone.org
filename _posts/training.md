Let's reflect on my calisthenics training over the past years and how I want to continue my workouts and bouldering practice going forward.

- Making the routine my own while training with Jack in Finland
- Bouldering

## Reddit's recommended routine

I started consciously training calisthenics after I discovered the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) from Reddit's bodyweight fitness community.
I kept track of my progress for the first few years using one of the Android apps made by the community.
Though I cannot seem to find my older data, here is a plot compiled from three quarters of a year during my Master's in Finland and Sweden.

This was still the old recommended routine; it has been updated in the meantime.
It consists of three parts: warmup, skills, strength.

Warmup included exercises like:
- Dynamic stretches
	- Shoulder rolls
	- Scapular shrugs
	- Camel bends
	- Straight arm overhead pulls, chest flies, and band dislocates
	- Front and side leg swings
	- Wrist mobility
- Bodyline drills
	- Planks (including sides and reverse)
	- Hollow hold and arch hold

Skills consisted of two exercises:
- Handstand progression
- Support progression (mostly straight bar support)

Strength exercises made up the moat of this workout.
There are three groups of two different exercises, where sets are done interchangably to give time for recovery but while still doing productive training.
I did three sets of every exercise.

The first group is arguably the most intense.
- Pull up progression (worked my way up to 3 sets of 10 reps)
- Dips progression

Second group was often a nice break, but maybe because I never took legs as serious as upper-body.
L-sits took me a while to practice.
- Squat progression
- L-sit progresion (I remember the moment I made it to 60s holds; felt glorious)

Third group is also pretty tough, targeting upper-body again.
- Push up progression
- Row progression

This whole routine worked pretty well for me.
I started out by doing these in my father's house, where I could do pull ups at the stairs (by putting a hockey stick through them) and dips using chairs and hockeysticks.
Every time I return to Tilburg, that is where I'll do my workout again.

While living in Finland, I did my workouts in UniSport Kluuvi during winter.
In Sweden I resorted to an outdoor calisthenics park on the university campus.
And back in Finland again, I started going to the athletics field on Aalto campus together with Jack.
