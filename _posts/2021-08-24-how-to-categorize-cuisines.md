title: The difficulty of categorizing cuisines by country

After starting my personal challenge of cooking meals from every country in the world, I started realizing that splitting up cuisines by country sometimes misses out on some larger and more meaningful patterns.
An example would be [Levantine cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levantine_cuisine).
The Levant is a historical geographical pointer to countries in the Eastern Mediterranean part of Western Asia; Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, parts of Turkey, sometimes stretching to include parts of Egypt and Libya.
An important common denominator of their respective cuisines is meze, with dishes including tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ghanoush.
I cooked ful medames once and put it under my Palestine tab, but it is actually cooked across the region, including Egypt, with which I found it first associated.
And there are many more such examples!
So instead, I think I should make an effort to classify cuisines on a more content-aware basis.

There are some very interesting Wikipedia articles related to food, cuisines, and history.

- A [timeline of foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_food), listing when certain ingredients came into existence in certain places
- A [list of historical cuisines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_cuisines), which includes Aztec, Maya, Inca, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, and many more cuisines
- A [list of cuisines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cuisines), in which the templates at the bottom contain more information than the actual article
- The [Wikimedia Cookbook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Table_of_Contents)

The Wikimedia cookbook nicely groups cuisines by region in the following ten categories.

- African cuisines
- East Asian cuisines
- European cuisines
- Mediterranean cuisines
- Middle Eastern cuisines
- North American cuisines
- Pacific cuisines
- South American cuisines
- South Asian cuisines
- Southeast Asian cuisines

However, this categorization seems to lack a place for [Central Asian cuisines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_cuisines#Central_Asian_cuisine) including Kazakh, Tajik, Uzbek, and others.
Furthermore, though Mediterranean is quite a distinct style, it feels superfluous in my categorization.
Might be better to replace it with Central Asian instead, thereby covering practically every part of the world in our ten regions.
