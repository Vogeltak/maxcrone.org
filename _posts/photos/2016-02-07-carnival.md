title: Carnival in Tilburg

desc: A perspective from the streets in Tilburg, The Netherlands, during the annual carnival in February. In my eyes, the whole event is a living Where's Wally illustration that I can walk through, and I think this photo resembles that well, with its large depth of field resulting in many different characters being in focus.
