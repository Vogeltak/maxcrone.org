title: What am I doing?
author: Max Crone
category: essay
excerpt: An attempt to describe my field of study to my father.
---
Recently, my father asked me to write a short essay that explains exactly what I am doing in my studies and where my interests lie.
Of course, he knows what I am studying, but his understanding of it does not reach far beyond the buzzwords *computer science*, *computer security* and *computer networks*.
In this essay, I will try my best to clearly explain my field of study such that my father will gain a useful intuition for it. Hi dad!

* Computer science
    * Applied mathematics
    * Abstract electrical engineering
    * Exposure to existing computer systems and security
* Computer security
    * Analysis of networking protocols
    * How do computers work **in practice**
    * Searching for unintended mistakes 
* Computer networks
    * Internet: how computers communicate with each other

See [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science)

I will start off by quickly mentioning the areas I have studied most recently at Aalto University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

* Seminar about protocols for certificate management
* Network security
* Mobile systems security
* Summer school in advanced hacking techniques (hack the box)
* Ethical hacking
* Communication System Design (flow classification methods in load balancing)
