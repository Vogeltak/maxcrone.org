Snow Crash is a fascinating cyberpunk classic with great world building but a rather lacking plot.

We're mostly following Hiro and Y.T. in their lives as they get entangled in a few threads.
The story takes its sweet time to kick off the plot, which basically doesn't boil down to anything more than stopping a bad guy who wants to destroy the world.
The unique strengths of Snow Crash lie somewhere else.

Most importantly, Neal presents an amazingly intricate and fleshed out world of semi-dystopian cyberpunk.
The novel was still brimming with cool ideas, and that is almost thirty years after it was first published.
I can only imagine how fascinating this must have been back in nineteen ninety-two.

What I enjoyed most about this book, were its chapters where Hiro was discussing with his Librarian daemon about ancient civilizations.
This included creation myths of Sumerian culture, their influence on later civilizations, possible conspiracies surrounding the bible.
These chapters (27, 28, 30, 33) precisely hook into what I was already interested in recently, after my investigations into historical cultures and their food.

Neal was also the one to coin the term *Metaverse*, in Snow Crash.
In the novel, it refers to the collective virtual space accessed through terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality on your goggles.
The Metaverse contains many references to real world computing culture, but adding plenty of fictional elements to it, which makes it a very rich illusion while reading.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend to read this nine-hundred+ page novel, to experience the fantasy of cyberpunk from one of its most influential sources.
