What I enjoyed most about this book, were its chapters where Hiro was discussing with his Librarian daemon about ancient civilizations.
This included creation myths of Sumerian culture, their influence on later civilizations, possible conspiracies surrounding the bible.
These chapters (27, 28, 30, 33) precisely hook into what I was already interested in recently, after my investigations into historical cultures and their food.
