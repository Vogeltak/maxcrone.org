*The cosmic game of hide and seek*; a brilliant introduction to parts of human philosophy grossly under-represented in Western society.

This book — which is a written account of some six lectures orated by Alan — is truly magnificent.
It treats large ontological questions head-on from fascinating philosophical perspectives (Hinduism, Buddhish, and Zen) while simultaneously criticizing Western religious thinking.
Alan has a likable wit in his words that make you so enormously excited to know more and to breathe a pleasant peace and joy in life.

Throughout this book I annotated disproportionately many phrases and paragraphs, considering its modest page count.
There is just too much beautiful brilliance in here.

## Part I: The nature of consciousness

> Any good scientist knows that what you call the external world is as much you as your own body.
> Your skin doesn't actually separate you from the world — it's a bridge through which the world flows into you, and you flow into the world.

> The myths underlying our culture and underlying our common sense have not taught us to feel identical with the universe.
> And that's why we feel alien to it, as if we were separate parts confronting the world.

> [...] that's the whole nature of God. To play that he's not God.
> God abandons himself — he gives himself away and gets lost.
> In this way, everybody is the fundamental reality — not God in a politically kingly sense, but God in the sense of being the self.
> Deep down, you're all this basic reality, but you're pretending that you're not.

> Your body is continuous with the total energy system of the cosmos.
> It's all you. But you're playing the game that you're this tiny, little bit of everything.

> And yet we persist with our little, partial view: "No, I'm just something in this body. I'm just this ego."
> What a joke. The ego is nothing other than the focus of conscious attention.
> It's like radar on a ship — it's a troubleshooter.

> You can't give up desire. It's like telling someone to be unselfish or get rid of their ego or let go and relax.
> Why would you want to do all that? Only because you're trying to beat the game.
> Because you're still operating under the hypothesis that you are different from the universe, so you want to get one up on it.
> And competing with the universe just reveals that you don't understand that you *are* the universe.
> You still think there's a real different between self and other, but the two are mutually necessary, just like the poles on a magnet.

> [...] gurus of all types tell you to know yourself, to look within, to find out who you really are,
> because the harder you look, the less you will find, and then you'll realize it was never there in the first place.
> There isn't a separate you. Your mind is what there is. It's everything. But the only way to find that out is to delve into the state of delusions as hard as possible.

## Part II: The web of life

> So if you're perfectly honest about loving yourself and don't pull any punches and don't pretend that you're anything other than exactly what you are,
> you suddenly come to discover that the self you love is the universe. You don't like all of it —
> you're still highly selective — but on the whole, you love yourself in terms of what is other.
> Because it's only in terms of what is other that you have a self at all.

> In other words, the more you are engaged with the external world, the more you are enriched.

## Part III: Inevitable ecstasy

> The reason we die is to give us the opportunity to unerstand what life is all about,
> and we can only experience that when we let go, because it is only then that we come to a situation that the ego can't deal with.

> In meditative consciousness, you will see that nothing is more important than anything else.
> And there is no such thing as wasting time, because what is time for except to be wasted?
> Just sit and do nothing. Meditation is the perfect waste of time.

## Part IV: The world as just so

> [...] bodhi in Sanskrit alludes to awakening from the illusion of being a separate ego locked up in a bag of skin.

> [...] simply because they are attached to punctuality as a fetish.
> We spend an awful lot of energy trying to make our lives fit images of what life is or should be —
> images which our lives could never possibly match or fit.
> So Zen practice entails getting rid of those images.

> When you first begin zazen — that is, sitting meditation — you don't do much other than count your breathing,
> maybe by tens, until your thoughts become more still.
> And Zen people don't close their eyes when they meditate, nor do they close their ears.
> They keep their eyes on the floor in front of them, and they don't try to force away any sounds that are going on
> or any smells or any other sensations whatsoever.
> They don't block any of that out.
> And as time goes on, they spend less time counting their breath and more time devoted to the koan assigned to them by the roshi —
> What is the sound of one hand clapping?
> Who were you before your father and mother conceived you?
> Does a dog have Buddha Nature?
> That sort of thing.

> Now, this all takes differing periods of time.
> For some people, it only takes ten years.

# Part V: The world as self

> [...] moksha — liberation.
> Liberation from the hallucination that you are just some poor little me.
> It means to wake up from that kind of hypnosis and discover that you are something being done by this vast,
> incredible self that has no beginning, no end, neither continuation nor discontinuation —
> it's beyond all categorization whatsoever.
> As the Upanishads say, "It is not this, it is not that."

> There's a famous Zen koan:
> "Before your father and mother conceived you, what was your original nature?"

> Americans in particular are terrible at this.
> Everything you do is done for some serious reason — it's the Protestant conscience.
> But play is that which is done just for itself — for fun.
> And the self — atman, Brahman — exists for fun.

> You have to work to survive, because you think you have to survive.
> But you don't have to. And this whole thing doesn't have to gon on, which is why  it does.
> I know that seems paradoxical, but think about it — life is full of examples of this.
> If I try to impress someone, I usually don't.
> If you try to too hard with anything, you usually make a mess of it.
> So the one self behind the world is engaged in play, which is why it is said that Brahman does not actually *become* the world —
> Brahman *plays* at being the world, which is distinct from *working at it*.

> What does any group of people like to do when they don't have to do anything?
> As far as I can tell, people get together and do something rhythmic — they dance, sing, and play games.

> We forget that trough implies crest, and crest implies trough.
> There is no such thing as pure sound — sound is sound/silence.
> Light is light/darkness.
> Light is pulsation — between everyr light pulse there is the dark pulse.

> There are Egyptiani inscriptions from 6000 BCE or so that describe the world as going hopelessly to the dogs.
> It seems this has always been the complaint.

> [...] things get worse and worse as time goes on until the end of the kali yuga when Shiva puts on a black appearance
> with ten arms and dances a dance called the tandava, in which the whole universe is destroyed in fire.

> So this involves certain ideas that are quite alien to the West.
> To begin with, the idea of the world as play.
> Our Lord God in the West tends to be overserious, and none of the famous Christian artists every painted Christ laughing or smiling.
> He's always this tragic figure who has this sort of look in his eye that says,
> "One of these days, you and I have to get together for a very serious talk."

> [...] the guru's job is to show the inquirer in some effective way that they are already what they are looking for.
> In Hindu traditions, realizing who you really are is called *sadhana*, which means "discipline."
> Sadhana is the way of life that is necessary to follow in order to escape from the illusion that you are merely a skin-encapsulated ego.

> [...] we are brought up in a social scheme that tells us we have to deserve what we get,
> and the price to pay for all good things is suffering.
> But all that is mere postponement.
> We are afraid here and now to see the truth.
> And if we had the nerve — you know, real nerve — we'd see it right away.
> But that's when we immediately feel that we shouldn't have nerve like that, because it would be awful.
> After all, we're supposed to feel like a poor little me who has to work and work and suffer in order to become something far away and great,
> like a Buddha or *jivanmukta* — someone who becomes liberated.

> *samadhi* — the attainment of nondualistic consciousness.

> *vanaprastha* — the person in Hindu society who has played the social game their entire life and now devotes themselves to self-discovery.

## Part VI: The world as emptiness

> [...] the Buddha proposed the Four Noble Truths: dukkha, trishna, nirvana, and marga.

> The Japanese word *yugen* refers to subtle profundity, but it's also a way of digging change.
> It's described poetically — you feel yugen when you see, out in the distance, some ships hidden behind a far-off island.
> You feel yugen when you watch wild geese fly, then suddenly disappear in the clouds.
> You feel yugen when you look across at a mountain you've never been to before, and you see the sky on the other side.
> You don't gove over there to look and see what's on the other side — that wouldn't be yugen.
> You let the other side be the other side, and it invokes something in your imagination, but you don't attempt to define it or pin it down.

> Things vanish into the mystery. And if you try to pursue them, you destroy yugen.

> They are liberated by the very fact on not being able to stop changing.

> Death isn't terrible — it's just going to be the end of you as a system of memories.
> So you've got a great chance right before it happens to let go of everything,
> because you know it's all going to go, and knowing that will help you let go.

> The dialectic method is perfectly simple and can be done with an individual student and teacher
> or with a group — you'd be amazed at how effective it is when it involves precious little more than discussion.
> The teacher gradually elicits from participants their basic premises on life — what their fundamental assumptions are.
> What is right and wrong?
> What is the good life?
> Where do you take your stand?
> And the teacher finds this out for each student and then demolishes it.

> Nagarjuna continued on to teach that you must "void the void" — that is, you mustn't cling to the void.
> And so the void of nonvoid is the great state, as it were, of Nagarjuna's Buddhism.
