After introducing me to the word epistemology, the essays in this book gave me exceptionally well-crafted ideas on thinking, argumentation, and communication.

I had seen and read some of the posts on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com) before, and I was fascinated by the sheer effort put into the writing and arguments.
