There are truly inspiring gems of microfiction in here, but reading them in book form is a shallow exercise.
They are clearly meant for microblogging platforms, where they intersperse one's other countless number of toots and tweets as welcome nuggets of fantasy.

I want to reproduce a few of them here.

> Plants raised in space produced nutrients that would silence the panic of being so deep in the deadly void.

> The rich didn't do their own dreaming; they hired technicians to create dreams for them.
> Every day teams of experts wrote flattering narrative so their corrupt employers could feel like heroes for a few hours each night.
> It soothed the conscience without the need to repent.

> We mastered antigravity, but the technology polluted our water.
> Rivers soared into the sky, and oceans flowed upward into mountain ranges.

> Moths mistake light bulbs for the extinct copper-lily, which grew by concentrating grounded lightning.
> To this day, hummingbirds still run on sips of nectar taken before the last blossom shorted out.

> By popular vote, cold weather was cancelled.
> Lavender snow fell on green fields that winter, carried by hot winds.
> Our breath still hung in the air as sticky-sweet dew.
> Society had little tolerance for those who longed for the vanishing cold.
> Soon the old seasons were forgotten.
