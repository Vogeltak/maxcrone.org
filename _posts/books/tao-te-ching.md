This translation is beautiful. Le Guin's prose and poetry are a vessel for this subject matter with unbeknownst resonance.

Some thoughts.

Many of the ideas from the Tao repeat the importance of *doing by not doing*. I recognize this in my own life, however, at the same time, I cannot help but wonder how this should work together with human qualities that make use more enjoyable in groups, such as initiative, "attentheid", etc. These are all qualities that require something more than mere pacifism. Where does intrinsic motivation come from to do things with others? If we follow the Ways (like the Wise Souls, the wind, water..) and not the humane proces, how do we ever get around to doing anything? Okay, okay, we do not *need* to be doing anything.
