The stories from Middle-Earth always conjure a nostalgic set of memories within me; how I used to drop by my best friend's house every week-end to go on adventures, watch The Lord of the Rings films over and over again, having dinner underneath their grapevines, petting their way too heavy cat Flip, running through their large house, drawing in the workspace of his dad, and so many more rich and fond memories. They seem to have all become mixed up in any revisiting of the primary works of Tolkien. Even though I did not read the actual books until I was fourteen or fifteen. And when I did, I tore through them all in seven days, during a trip to the south of France. Am I making new memories when re-reading these works or will they keep on telling me the same stories for ever?
