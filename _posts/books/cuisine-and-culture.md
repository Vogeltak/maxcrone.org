Concerning the Inca society in South America, the Aztec society in Central America, and the Cahokia society in Northern America.

### Inca's

Special ceramic pots and jars for transport and storage, adorned with geometric designs.
No private ownership of land.
Government directed farmers to build irrigation systems and terraces on the hills.
Eating was communal too.
The main, morning meal was required to be eaten in the plaza, including the emperor.
People brought their own food and were encouraged to share with each other.
Same goes for drinks, which they only consumed after they finished eating.

Quinoa was the sacred "mother grain" (rich in high-quality protein).

> Alexander von Humboldt went to the Andes and said that in South America, quinoa was what "wine was to the greeks, wheat to the romans, cotton to the Arabs."

Another source of protein is *cuy* (guinea pig), which the Inca had domesticated by 2000 B.C.
Taste has been described as fishy pork.
Roasted whole, hair off, skin on, seasoned with chile, gutted, and the cavity filled with hot stones.

*Vizcacha*; body like a rabbit, tail like a fox.

*Charque* is the word for preserved foods produced by drying; mostly done with llama meat.

Fish from the coast was dried to feed the army.

The Inca cultivated more than 3000 varieties of potato (domesticated between 3700 and 3000 B.C.).
Their method of preservation was *freeze-drying*:

1. squeeze out the moisture during the day by crushing the potatoes with their feet (like grapes for wine)
2. leave them out to dry
3. the dry potatoes freeze at night; these are now called *chu√±os*

These could be kept in storehouses indefinitely, together with other produce such as quinoa, fruits, greens, legumes, sun-dried meat and fish, salted meat and fish, and water.
The native people of the Andes have domesticated more root crops rich in carbohydrates than any other people, but most haven't caught on outside the Andex.
Some examples are listed: achira, ahipa, arracacha, maca, mashua mauka, oca, ulluco, and yacon.

The potato was the success story, only introduced in the 1550s by the Spanish conquistadores returning to Europe.

When cooking at higher altitudes, water boils at lower temperatures, so food will take longer to cook.
Thus at higher altitudes, people tended to cook more by frying.

Other staple foods include:

- corn (bigger kernels, different taste and texture)
- squash (of which the seeds are highly nutritious, but most everything of the plant was eaten)
- fruits
    - goldenberry, pepino, tamarillo, cherimoya
    - loganberry (produces deep red juice), "blueberry of the Andes", giant Columbian blackberry
    - cactus fruit, plantains, inga pods
    - strawberry
    - tomato, chili pepper
