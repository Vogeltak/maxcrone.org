Jemisin does not mess around and writes short stories that pack a punch and hit their story beats very efficiently.

I enjoyed many of the stories in this book, which is high praise for short story collections in my experience. I got this book as a paper hardcover and I started writing down my thoughts at the beginning of every story after I finished it. The feel of writing with black ink in a paper book is something peculiar. It feels wrong on many levels, but rationally it just makes sense to keep my notes and thoughts as close to the source as possible. Only later do I want to synthesize these into something more coherent. And that time is now, so here we go.

**TODO: will update with what I thought of all stories after I get back from Northern Europe.**
