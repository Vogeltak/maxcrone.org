I was at a summer solstice event where one woman's performance was music made with lasers and metal sheets.

She'd strapped lasers to her head, so her gaze upon different sheets caused weird sounds.

Then she took a gun-contraption and put it on her chin. By pointing the laser to some metal sheet and making small sounds with her mouth, the space filled with even more otherworldly and eerie sounds.
