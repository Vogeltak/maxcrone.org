Here is an idea of how heaven smells: heat a drop of olive oil in a pan, then toast a mix of almond slivers, salt, pepper, and *baharat*. Baharat is this [Middle Eastern mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baharat) of allspice, cinnamon, coriander, black- and white peppercorns, ginger, cloves, nutmeg (and possibly other spices).
