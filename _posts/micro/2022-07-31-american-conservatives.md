Paraphrasing from [De Groene](https://www.groene.nl/artikel/een-hillbilly-gaat-naar-washington):

The success of Conservatives in the USA has come to depend on the extent to which voters believe that Democrats only ever talk about diversity and gender, and never about jobs.

Conservatives would like Forgotten America to suffer just a bit longer, precisely long enough to be able to claim that the Biden administration has done nothing for the Working Class.
