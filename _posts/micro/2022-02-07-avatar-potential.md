What are some possibilities of avatars in a metaverse? Will they be backed by AI that is intimately familiar with personal individuals to a degree that it can act as a conversational substitute in meetings? Will they be able to summarize the most important points and decisions after the meeting has been concluded? We are going to lend increasing amounts of agency to these avatars. To exercise useful agency requires  access to personal calendars, communication history, and work documents. Furthermore, to sell the conversational substitutionalism, avatars are going to use deepfake technology to simulate our human presence via image and voice.
