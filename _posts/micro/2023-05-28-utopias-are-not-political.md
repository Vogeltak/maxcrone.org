A utopia is not a place where everyone's hobby is to think and debate political organization and democracy/anarchy.
Instead, a utopia would be a world where people enjoy each other's company and conversation, where they enjoy nature in a sustainable and reverend manner, and where issues are peacefully resolved; bottom-up and cooperatively.
In such a utopia, life wouldn't be a fight for the right to live.
People instead derive value from seeing each other happy.
