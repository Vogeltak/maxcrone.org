Some impressions from watching NVIDIA's GTC 2023 keynote:

- NVIDIA just keeps pumping out industry-specific software libraries to increase relevance (and lock-in) of its hardware
- AI Computer Vision library, CV-CUDA, together with ByteDance (eighty percent of internet traffic is video content)
- Computational lithography
- DGX AI supercomputers (huge deal with Microsoft for H100s)
- Generative AI is a new platform (like the internet)
- NVIDIA AI Foundations, an "AI foundry"
- Lots of targeted Accelerator configurations for different workloads (this is a business decision, because NVIDIA wouldn't earn as much if it admitted that most organizations are also perfectly fine for their use cases without the top-of-the-line, bleeding-edge hardware)
- Omniverse seems mostly useful for generating synthetic data (i.e., mostly for autonomous vehicles right now)
- NVIDIA DGX Cloud (Azure, GCP, OCI), NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud (Azure)
