excerpt: What would Humboldt and the Republic of Letters have looked like if we gave all scientists smartphones and instant messaging?
---
Recently, I read [The Invention of Nature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Nature) by Andrea Wulf. Among other cool things, she talks about the [Republic of Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters), which is a term for the long-distance intellectual community in the late 17th and 18th centuries in Europe and the Americas. On multiple counts, she writes about Humboldt thinking what a blessing it must be if scientists across the world were able to communicate instantaneously with each other.
These thoughts of Humboldt's were sparked by the advent of the commercial telegraph in the United States that allowed communication from coast-to-coast with a speed never seen before.

Now, Humboldt was an avid correspondent who received many letters from around the world. While researching his books, he was entangled in many long-distance conversations about the different topics he wrote on. That left me wondering what Humboldt could have additionally achieved if he were to have worked during our era of the internet, or, if the scientific community in his era would have had access to instant messaging as we know it today.

I wanted to relate this to some passages I remember reading somewhere, that basically boiled down to the following.

> We made tremendous technological developments over the last years, but all I got was this shitty piece of glass with apps that keep trying to distract me.

I would like to argue that this is actually a blessing in disguise. Even though the anonymous source of this message meant to put the current smartphone developments in a negative light, I can't help but see the immense value of it when thinking about the potential this could have had if it was around during Humboldt's life. 
Humboldt's *Cosmos* would have taken many years less to complete, and the man would maybe have had time for a fifth and sixth part in the series.

## How the Republic of Letters worked
There were three important elements that facilitated this Republic of Letters.

1. Academies
2. Salons
3. Printing press

### Academies
Academic institutions — including journals and literary societies — started popping up in large, cultural hubs of the Western world in the 17th century.
London gained the Royal Society in 1662 and Paris birthed the Académie des Sciences in 1666.
These institutions brought together scientifically endeavoring individuals in the area and gave them a platform for discourse.
Furthermore, as these institutions grew, intellectuals went traveling between them, thereby disseminating the ideas being cultivated at one institution to many of the other scientific hubs.
This prepared the cosmopolitan mindset of the academics.
