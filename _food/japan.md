## Miso soup

Starting off this wonderfully delicate and interesting cuisine with a very simple dish.
A light miso soup, together with rice, serves as a staple food for the mornings in Japan.
For dinner, I will be bulking the dish out with leafy vegetables, noodles, and tofu.

There are a few resources I enjoyed while preparing.
Kenji's [video on miso soup](https://youtu.be/U_Y9BUP3VVI) is very insightful, as usual.
And there is the delightful [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/) post on this dish.
I will remember Namiko Hirasawa Chen's great website for future dives into the Japanese cuisine.

In recent years I have cooked a variety of Japanese food already.
There is that time I made a ramen broth from scratch with a friend.
And other times we rolled our own sushi.
These past experiences provide some springboards for future research directions.

The miso soup builds on top of a broth called *dashi*.
