## Doro wat and injera
Doro wat is an Ethiopian stew made from chicken. People most often eat this atop injera, which is a sour fermented flatbread traditionally made from teff flour.

See Wikipedia's articles on [injera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera) and [wat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_(food)).
