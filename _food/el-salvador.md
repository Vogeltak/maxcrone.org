## Casamiento

{% include image.html name="2023-07-22-casamiento" size="1280" caption="Salvadoran beans and rice, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2023." %}

Yet another rice and beans dish; though it starts to feel slightly cheap to consider this as a unique entry.

See the [entry in the TasteAtlas](https://www.tasteatlas.com/casamiento) and [Cristina's video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sWQYxJKl4).

Prepare bell peppers (preferably *with* some green ones, for some bitterness), onions, and tomatoes.
All diced in roughly equal dice.

Start by sauteeing rice in oil (to get some starch off).
Add onion, followed by the bell pepper and tomatoes after it starts to look glassy.
Make sure you have some beans ready to go; either having soaked and boiled them until they're done but still firm, or by using a tin of beans.
Cristina seems to use red kidney beans, but I had some dried black-eyed beans lying around that I used.
Add them to the pot and stir to combine everything.
Season with salt and pourin enough water to just cover everything.
Continue to boil on medium heat until the rice is done.

Garnish with cilantro and optionally serve with some quick onion and tomato relish.
