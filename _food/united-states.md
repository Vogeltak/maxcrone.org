## Pancakes

We made a purely veganistic batter, with bananas squashed in for extra structure and richness.
These tasted exceptionally decadent.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake#United_States_and_Canada) for more background.
There appear to be many varieties of pancakes around the world, of course.

One particular variant from Northern America is a pancake made with sourdough.
*Prospectors* would be foraying into new terrain looking for resources, carrying sourdough with them because it could last indefinitely so long they replenished it with water and flour.
Much easier than having to find and buy yeast in areas where that wasn't likely to be very common.
I've initialized a sourdough starter today (2022-08-20) that I will definitely use to create some pancakes with in the near future.
