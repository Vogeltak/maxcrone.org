## Tteokbokki

*Tteokbokki* is dish of simmered rice cakes. I had bought a bag of frozen rice cake noodles from a large grocery store some time ago, and only later did I discover its popularity in Korean cuisine. Luckily I did already have some *gochujang* (Korean chili paste) on hand, which is a very common ingredient in this dish. Though the gochujang is actually more sweet and less spicy than I expected it to be. Alas, we can always tweak our spice levels if we feel the need.

As of now I am not including a picture yet, because the one I took when I first made tteokbokki  was terribly wintery (i.e., no daylight, ugly lamps). It's starting to turn to summer in Amsterdam again though, so when I prepare the dish again I will be sure to snap a nice and light photo.

Tteokbokki is quite simple to prepare. Two good sources are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteokbokki) and [Maangchi](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/tteokbokki) (who appears to be insanely popular in online cooking culture).

Simmer kombu in some water and remove it after ten minutes or so. Stir in the rice cakes, gochujang, and chili flakes. Gentrly simmer until the sauce starts to thicken and the rice cakes turn soft (they won't fall apart and will remain incredibly chewy). Around the end I put in some bok choy to fill out the dish a bit more.
