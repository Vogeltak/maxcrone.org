## Ribollita

{% include image.html name="2021-10-09-ribollita" size="1280" caption="Ribollita in my father's kitchen in early autumn, Tilburg, 2021." %}

Ribollita is a Tuscan peasant soup, traditionally *reheated* from leftover minestrones and other foodstuffs.
Not a glamorous introduction to the rich Italian cuisine, arguably.
I've made Italian lasagna's, ragù's, fish-, and vegetable-dishes before, but none of those in the context of this project.
So I don't want to include them in my notes (mostly because I don't have pleasing photos yet; no, but *really* because I just prefer writing my thoughts one-at-a-time in recent-relevant contexts).

Good sources of course include [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribollita), [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016052-ribollita), but also *The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking* by Marcella Hazan (p.113 has a "Tuscan peasant soup with cabbage and beans" called *acquacotta*; it is a bit richer, including eggs, Parmesan cheese, and lemon).
Also read through this nice article on [Trattoria Mario's ribollita](https://divinacucina.com/2015/01/trattoria-marios-ribollita/) on the cute [Divina Cucina](https://divinacucina.com/). Now there is also a recipe from [NonnaBox](https://www.nonnabox.com/ribollita/).

By making this from scratch, I slightly nullified the meaning of this dish (it being reheated leftovers), but I made sure to prepare plenty of soup so that my father would be able to eat it on days dotted throughout the week, thereby redeeming the meaning a little.

Start by sautéeing a sofrito of onion, carrot, and celery with salt.
When properly softened, throw in aromatics: garlic and tomato paste and sear their edge off.
Pour in a can of crushed tomatoes and enough vegetable broth to cover. 
Add a bouquet of rosemary and thyme to the pot.
Put in a good bunch of chopped kale leaves, possibly first stirring it through so that everything slinks a bit, before adding more.
Aim for roughly one-hundred grams of kale per person.
I added some cubed stale bread (the same as I'll be describing further down) to the soup here, to bulk it out while soaking and softening.
Cover and let it simmer for as many hours as you reasonably want to wait, replenishing water when necessary.
A couple of tens of minutes before serving, include cannellini beans and stir them through.
Check for seasoning, extending the dish with salt and black pepper where necessary.

Most recipes stress the importance of good Tuscan (unsalted) bread, or at least something that gets you excited when crunching, cutting, and biting into.
In my father's hometown there is an amazing sourdough bakery that bakes the most delicious breads with amazingly flavorful slightly-burned crusts.
We got some bread from there.
Aim for something like this.
I find that great bread brings a disproportionately high amount of life satisfaction.
Might be something personal.
Don't bother with pulling a faux-onion-soupy move by putting slices of bread in your serving bowls, covering it with cheese, and grilling it in an oven for a few minutes.
Grate good chase over your servings instead, and serve with the bread on the side.
Might sprinkle with fresh herbs to your liking as garnish.

## Bagna càuda

We made this Piedmontese fondue-like dish from garlic and anchovies for Christmas with my family, as one of the appetizers. Served it with plenty of fresh vegetables. I am ashamed to say that we used heavy cream in our preparation of the dish. To refrain from offending any Italians, just use butter and olive oil as your sources of fat.

Also see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagna_c%C3%A0uda) and the [Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook](https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Gk7OAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

## Risotto

{% include image.html name="2022-03-13-risotto" size="1280" caption="Risotto with mushrooms, in my apartment in Amsterdam, 2022." %}

Ah, the classic comfort dish. I used to have a period of time in which Max and I would regularly prepare different risottos, and [watch Gennaro](https://youtu.be/VOBihHeZuXE) be his extravagant Italian self. Amazing.

Perform a quick mise en place:

- Fetch some arborio rice
- Dice some onion
- Set a nice broth to simmer next to your risotto pan on the stove
- Get enough butter (really, you can never have enough butter for risotto)
- Buy some good white wine (shaoxing does actually also work to a satisfying degree)
- Parmesan cheese (I either use grana padano or parmigiano reggiano, or both)
- Prepare some ingredients to pimp your risotto

The pimping of a risotto must be a conscious act. Conscious in the sense that you do not want to over-pimp. Just like with much of the Italian cuisine, less is more. Some good pimps are:

- a mix of mushrooms
- pumpkin
- asparagus (green, naturally, the only type Italians consider worthy, according to Marcella Hazan in her small book on ingredients)
- or, a natural bianco

To start, sweat onions in butter and olive oil. Then throw in your arborio rice naked. Stir a few minutes until the starch layer has fried off. Pour in your cooking wine and let the alcohol evaporate. Now the fun starts. We are going to be continuously stirring our risotto on low heat, ladling in hot broth from time to time (only a couple of spoonfuls). Continue until the rice is just done; nice and soft, no hard starchy kernel when you bite into it. We have added our pimps somewhere along this journey, depending on their specific cooking time.

To finish the risotto, grate in an unhealthy dose of parmesan, and add in another block of butter. Put a lid on the pan, take it off the heat, and let sit for ten minutes.

To serve, ladle on a plate and shake it to all sides, spreading it out. Garnish with some fresh parsley.
