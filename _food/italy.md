## Ribollita

{% include image.html name="2021-10-09-ribollita" size="1280" caption="Ribollita in my father's kitchen in early autumn, Tilburg, 2021." %}

Ribollita is a Tuscan peasant soup, traditionally *reheated* from leftover minestrones and other foodstuffs.
Not a glamorous introduction to the rich Italian cuisine, arguably.
I've made Italian lasagna's, ragù's, fish-, and vegetable-dishes before, but none of those in the context of this project.
So I don't want to include them in my notes (mostly because I don't have pleasing photos yet; no, but *really* because I just prefer writing my thoughts one-at-a-time in recent-relevant contexts).

Good sources of course include [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribollita), [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016052-ribollita), but also *The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking* by Marcella Hazan (p.113 has a "Tuscan peasant soup with cabbage and beans" called *acquacotta*; it is a bit richer, including eggs, Parmesan cheese, and lemon).
Also read through this nice article on [Trattoria Mario's ribollita](https://divinacucina.com/2015/01/trattoria-marios-ribollita/) on the cute [Divina Cucina](https://divinacucina.com/). Now there is also a recipe from [NonnaBox](https://www.nonnabox.com/ribollita/).

By making this from scratch, I slightly nullified the meaning of this dish (it being reheated leftovers), but I made sure to prepare plenty of soup so that my father would be able to eat it on days dotted throughout the week, thereby redeeming the meaning a little.

Start by sautéeing a sofrito of onion, carrot, and celery with salt.
When properly softened, throw in aromatics: garlic and tomato paste and sear their edge off.
Pour in a can of crushed tomatoes and enough vegetable broth to cover. 
Add a bouquet of rosemary and thyme to the pot.
Put in a good bunch of chopped kale leaves, possibly first stirring it through so that everything slinks a bit, before adding more.
Aim for roughly one-hundred grams of kale per person.
I added some cubed stale bread (the same as I'll be describing further down) to the soup here, to bulk it out while soaking and softening.
Cover and let it simmer for as many hours as you reasonably want to wait, replenishing water when necessary.
A couple of tens of minutes before serving, include cannellini beans and stir them through.
Check for seasoning, extending the dish with salt and black pepper where necessary.

Most recipes stress the importance of good Tuscan (unsalted) bread, or at least something that gets you excited when crunching, cutting, and biting into.
In my father's hometown there is an amazing sourdough bakery that bakes the most delicious breads with amazingly flavorful slightly-burned crusts.
We got some bread from there.
Aim for something like this.
I find that great bread brings a disproportionately high amount of life satisfaction.
Might be something personal.
Don't bother with pulling a faux-onion-soupy move by putting slices of bread in your serving bowls, covering it with cheese, and grilling it in an oven for a few minutes.
Grate good chase over your servings instead, and serve with the bread on the side.
Might sprinkle with fresh herbs to your liking as garnish.

## Bagna càuda

We made this Piedmontese fondue-like dish from garlic and anchovies for Christmas with my family, as one of the appetizers. Served it with plenty of fresh vegetables. I am ashamed to say that we used heavy cream in our preparation of the dish. To refrain from offending any Italians, just use butter and olive oil as your sources of fat.
