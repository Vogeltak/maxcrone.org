### Ful mudammas

I have come to the conclusion that it is virtually impossible to ascribe a dish to a single country.
Either a country's borders are quite arbitrary and thus do not necessarily contain a single culture.
This is the case with many African countries.
Or, countries in relative geographical vicinity have just been influenced by similar cultures, religions, invaders, and whatever else history threw at them.

Ful medames (which is the non-Arabic English spelling) actually originates in Egypt, from where it was exported across parts of the Arab, African, and Asian world.
Why am I putting this under Palestine then?
Well, while researching different versions of this dish, I also encountered a great Palestinian-American cook who made a [Palestinian variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQSWEt4l5xE).
She noted that a real Palestinian version would use a mix of fava beans and chickpeas.
This is important, because the only fava beans I could find in Finnish shops were those mixed with chickpeas in a tin.
Looked like I had to go with the Palestinian variation after all!

No problem of course, it still tastes amazing.

On a slow heat, start by sizzling some minced garlic and ground cumin.
I also threw in some leftover habanero, but you can easily do without.
When your aromatics are lightly colored, throw in the drained and rinsed fava beans + chickpeas.
Up the heat a tad, and throw in a couple splashes of water.
Crack some salt and pepper to taste, and simmer away.
I was looking to properly soften up the beans, so they could easily be mushed later on.
Keep adding water if necessary.
Mash the ful to an appealing consistency, and ladle in a nicer serving bowl than I had access to.
Garnish with chopped tomato, parsley, lemon, and a good drizzle of olive oil.
I served it with some quickly pickled vegetables and fresh flatbread.

Now apparently Palestinian traditional grandma's scoop up the ful with onions that have been soaking in some good olive oil.
Naturally, I tried my hand at that too.
It is a bit intense, but good to have tried.
