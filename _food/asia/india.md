## Khichdi

{% include image.html name="2021-04-10-khichdi" size="1280" caption="Northern Indian khichdi in my room in Helsinki, 2021." %}

Indian cuisines are deliciously plenty and complex to break into.
So many different regions, people, ingredients, etc.
Khichdi seems to be a popular dish in many regions, although mostly in the northern part of the country.
For inspiration I read through [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi) and found a popular recipe on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYWtizV5oCI).

- Heat some oil and infuse with cumin seeds (and asafoetida, if you have some).
- Garlic, ginger => in.
- Onion
- Chopped fresh tomatoes and green chilies
- After a few minutes I also added some green peas
- Add more spices; turmeric, chili, garam masala
- Add and fry your rice and lentils (1:1)
- Cover with water and simmer with lid on for a while

For serving, we top the khichdi with a [tadka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempering_(spices)); tempered spices.
The fat of the oil carries the spices beautifully.
I tempered some chili flakes, cumin seeds, and cardemom.
