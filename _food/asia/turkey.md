[Turkish cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine) is a fascinating fusion of culinary traditions with influences from Levantine, Egyptian, Greek, Balkan, and Central Asian cuisines.

Lots of vegetables dishes, rice, pasta, meats, mezes, salads.

Specific dishes I still want to make some time.

- [Köfte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6fte)
- [Sarma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarma_(food)) *stuffed grape leaves* (a form of [dolma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolma) or *mahshi* in Arabic)
- [Adana kebabı](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana_kebab%C4%B1)

## Menemen

Pronouncing this dish already feels delicious.

What I made today is definitely not a traditional recipe though.
See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxXw0eSSC0) by J. Kenji López-Alt for a much better idea of traditional menemen (and nice vibes in general).
Didn't have proper green peppers, so I had to make do with the much too sweet red bellpepper.
Worst of all, I added mixed beans in there too, because it was still in my fridge and had to be used before I went out to a cottage in mid-Finland for the weekend.

Okay, backing up a bit.
Menemen is a Turkish dish often eaten for breakfast, kind of similar to the more widespread shakshouka.
There is deep disagreement in Turkish society about the addition of onions to the dish.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemen_(food)) for a short overview.
Of course I added onions though.
Sauté onion and pepper first, in a good glug of olive oil.
Add grated/diced tomato and simmer for around ten minutes on relatively low heat.
Season with salt and plenty of black pepper.
Just before serving, throw in a couple of eggs, and very carefully scramble them through the sauce.

I served these with freshly baked, buttery pita breads.
See the [baker's percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage) breakdown.

- Flour
- Water (50%)
- Dairy(15%) (although I used oat milk)
- Sugar (3%)
- Salt (2%)
- Yeast (2%)
- Olive oil (1%)

Upon serving, top menemen with crumbled feta.
