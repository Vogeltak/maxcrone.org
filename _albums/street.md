  Street photography from places I've lived in (a.o., Amsterdam, Helsinki,
  Stockholm). But also from any other places I've visited over the years.
  This might be my favorite genre of photography overall. I love walking
  around in centres of human civilizations with a cute little purpose of
  observing the interesting things happening around me.
