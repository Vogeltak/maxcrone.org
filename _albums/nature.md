  Both in The Netherlands (bogs, dunes) and outside. Nature is a genre that
  I have relatively little experience in. Most shots are from moments where I
  was out with friends or family and thought to bring a camera along. But
  I'm thinking about doing trips more focused on photograps; optimizing for
  time of day, light, and weather conditions.
