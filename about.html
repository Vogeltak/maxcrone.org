	<h1>About</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        I am a Master's student in Security and Cloud Computing at Aalto University and KTH.
        My place of study is Helsinki for this semester.
        I embarked on these adventures after I finished the Computer Science Bachelor at the Eindhoven University of Technology in my home country, The Netherlands.

        Let me increase the dimensionality of my personality.
        I love to read books and short stories (mostly science fiction and fantasy, but I do enjoy good non-fiction work from time to time).
        I like to think that I enjoy writing, but dedicating myself to the craft proves to be non-trivial.
        The amount of good content being published makes it too easy to slip into a comfortably passive mindset sometimes, instead of making the effort to create something oneself.

        I enjoy cooking meals from around the world, because it allows me to, quite literally, get a taste of humankind's cultures.
        Photography gives me the visual satisfaction that I am left craving while studying computer science.
        Lastly, I enjoy the game of Ultimate Frisbee and I like to practice calisthenics.
        Oftentimes, I can also be found hiking through nature or cities.
