<p>—Kwangu Liwewe and Alec D'Angelo, <a href="https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/africas-ai-strongmen/">Africa's AI strongmen</a>, New Lines Magazine</p>
<p>This piece feels like a premonition of what the abundance of generative AI will lead to in politics across the world.
But in this case, it's already happening in African military dictatorships.
"Digital mythmaking" as a description of this phenomenon feels like such a good term for this new form of propaganda.</p>

<p>Eerlijkheid, consistentie, bereidheid tot vergeving.
Het zijn allemaal belangrijke ingrediënten van vertrouwen in een relatie, maar de belangrijkste zijn kennis en begrip.
Kennis over jezelf – je eigen zwaktes, sterke punten – en kennis over de ander.
Om die te krijgen moet je heel precies kijken en luisteren.
Niet alleen naar de ander, ook naar jezelf.</p>

        <span class="feed-item-content"><p>Nina Menkes's <em>Brainwashed: sex-camera-power</em> does it all.
It serves both as a masterfully articulated indictment of the patriarchal and propagandist status quo and as an inspiring anthology of post-patriarchal cinema.
Nina incites within us a yearning for ambiguous excitement and significance far beyond the male gaze.
Here's to the hope that we can transcend the shallow male-centricity of cinema and actually explore the richness of humanity.</p>

Instead, a utopia would be a world where people enjoy each other's company and conversation, where they enjoy nature in a sustainable and reverend manner, and where issues are peacefully resolved; bottom-up and cooperatively.
In such a utopia, life wouldn't be a fight for the right to live.
People instead derive value from seeing each other happy.</p>

<ul>
<li>NVIDIA just keeps pumping out industry-specific software libraries to increase relevance (and lock-in) of its hardware</li>
<li>AI Computer Vision library, CV-CUDA, together with ByteDance (eighty percent of internet traffic is video content)</li>
<li>Computational lithography</li>
<li>DGX AI supercomputers (huge deal with Microsoft for H100s)</li>
<li>Generative AI is a new platform (like the internet)</li>
<li>NVIDIA AI Foundations, an "AI foundry"</li>
<li>Lots of targeted Accelerator configurations for different workloads (this is a business decision, because NVIDIA wouldn't earn as much if it admitted that most organizations are also perfectly fine for their use cases without the top-of-the-line, bleeding-edge hardware)</li>
<li>Omniverse seems mostly useful for generating synthetic data (i.e., mostly for autonomous vehicles right now)</li>

        <span class="feed-item-content"><p>Paraphrasing from Joost de Vries in <a href="https://www.groene.nl/artikel/avant-gardisten-van-de-beschaving">De Groene</a>:</p>
<p>We could say that the West only has a democratic tradition if we ignore the years between the time of Greek city states and the American revolution of 1776.</p>
<p>And isn't it strange that we in Northwestern Europe tend to associate more with a Roman general who transcribed their military campaigns than the Germanic tribes they conquered—who were our <em>actual</em> ancestors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, none of the values and freedoms we like to call Western are inherently, endemically Western; every form of self-government has also appeared somewhere else in the world.</p>

        <span class="feed-item-content"><p>Dan Wang writes about Yunnan cuisine in his <a href="https://danwang.co/2022-letter/">2022 reflection letter</a>.
When I'd write about fictional solarpunk cuisine, this is what inspires me:</p>
<p>I can describe Yunnan cuisine only through dishes special to me.
I think of pickled bamboo shoots, gently fried, lending their funky sourness to fish soups.
I think of ham, sometimes steamed on its own, sometimes sautéd with some chili peppers, sometimes dropped in the pot to enliven a broth.
I think of whole stems of flowers, tossed with vinegar in salad.
I think of various types of rice noodles, in thick strings like Udon or as thumb-sized slices, which are more supple-bodied and offer greater chewiness than noodles made of wheat.
I think of simple farm cheeses—a rare find in Chinese culinary traditions—steamed with slices of ham.
I think of spicy pickles, indiscriminately sharpening the flavors of noodle soups or a vegetable dish, say a quick fry of lotus root.
I think of yellow strips of pea pudding, tossed in chili oil, vinegar, and some bean sprouts.
I think of a simple lunch of rice cakes fried with ham, eggs, and chives.
I think of stewed beef garnished with handfuls of fresh mint, of mashed potatoes that do not drown in butter but are suffused with salty pickles, and of simple pans of soup that have up to a half-dozen types of dark, leafy greens.</p>

        <span class="feed-item-content"><p>David Graeber <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fragments-of-an-anarchist-anthropology">writes</a>:</p>
<p>What sort of social theory would actually be of interest to those who are trying to help bring about a world in which people are free to govern their own affairs?</p>
<p>For starters, I would say any such theory would have to begin with some initial assumptions.
Not many.
Probably just two.
First, it would have to proceed from the assumption that, as the Brazilian folk song puts it, <strong>“another world is possible.”</strong>
That institutions like the state, capitalism, racism and male dominance are not inevitable; that it would be possible to have a world in which these things would not exist, and that we’d all be better off as a result.
To commit oneself to such a principle is almost an act of faith, since how can one have certain knowledge of such matters?
[...]</p>
<p>The second, I’d say, is that any anarchist social theory would have to <strong>reject self-consciously any trace of vanguardism</strong>.
The role of intellectuals is most definitively not to form an elite that can arrive at the correct strategic analyses and then lead the masses to follow.
But if not that, what?
This is one reason I’m calling this essay “Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology”—because this is one area where I think anthropology is particularly well positioned to help.
And not only because most actually-existing self-governing communities, and actually-existing non-market economies in the world have been investigated by anthropologists rather than sociologists or historians.
It is also because the practice of ethnography provides at least something of a model, if a very rough, incipient model, of how nonvanguardist revolutionary intellectual practice might work.

        <span class="feed-item-content"><p>Cédric Durand writes the following in the <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii136/articles/cedric-durand-scouting-capital-s-frontiers">New Left Review</a>:</p>
<p>"On the one hand, the growing weight of financial capital retained as cash holdings suggests a lack of investment opportunities.
On the other hand, the fact that firms with top operational profit rates also hold particularly large stocks of intangibles suggests that their growth strategies increasingly rely on the acquisition of existing firms.
These developments are consistent with the diagnosis of a dysfunctional capitalism, where capital centralization takes place through processes of predation largely disconnected from productive activities—the rationale of surplus appropriation in the techno-feudal hypothesis."</p>
<p>This comes from an essayistic response to earlier essays discussing <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii133/articles/evgeny-morozov-critique-of-techno-feudal-reason">techno-feudalism</a> (Evgeny Morozov) and <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii135/articles/timothy-erik-strom-capital-and-cybernetics">cyber-capitalism</a> (Timothy Erik Ström)</p>

And <a href="https://danluu.com/elon-twitter-texts/">published them on his website</a> in clear text.</p>
<p>These make for a fascinating insight into personal communication between high-profile business people and investors.
All of these rich people appear to be sucking up to Elon, or otherwise being very careful not to offend him in any way.
Meanwhile Elon is just talking to them all rather brusquely; makes for quite a funny read.</p>
