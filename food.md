I organize my notes on different cuisines by splitting them into rough geographical areas with the intention of grouping together similar cuisines.
A country's cuisine has rarely developed on its own.
Cuisines are as dynamic, flexible, and arbitrary as the concept of nation states and their borders.
I wrote some [more detailed thoughts](/thoughts/how-to-categorize-cuisines) on this in the past.

Let's start from ten top-level regions.

- [Africa](#africa) <span class="fraction">5/55</span>
- [Central Asia](#central-asia) <span class="fraction">1/5</span>
- [East Asia](#east-asia) <span class="fraction">1/6</span>
- [Europe](#europe) <span class="fraction">2/44</span>
- [Middle East](#middle-east) <span class="fraction">4/19</span>
- [North America](#north-america) <span class="fraction">2/23</span>
- [Pacific](#pacific) <span class="fraction">0/14</span>
- [South America](#south-america) <span class="fraction">1/12</span>
- [South Asia](#south-asia) <span class="fraction">1/8</span>
- [Southeast Asia](#southeast-asia) <span class="fraction">0/11</span>

A very interesting source of consistent investigations into cuisines around the world is the [Food in Every Country](http://www.foodbycountry.com/) website.

## Africa

African cuisines are further categorized by cardinal directions.

### Northern Africa <span class="fraction">2/6</span>

Influences from Phoenicians (sausages), Carthaginians (wheat, semolina), Berbers (couscous), Arabs (spices: saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, cloves), Ottoman Turks (pastries), and New World (potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini, chili peppers).

- [Egypt](/food/egypt)
	- Koshari *rice, macaroni, lentils, spiced tomato sauce, chickpeas*
- [Tunisia](/food/tunisia)
	- Lablabi *chickpeas in garlic-cumin broth*

### Eastern Africa <span class="fraction">1/19</span>

- [Kenya](/food/kenya)
	- Mandazi *fried bread*

### Southern Africa <span class="fraction">0/5</span>

### Western Africa <span class="fraction">2/16</span>

Many of the dishes I list under specific countries are mostly eaten throughout the whole region.
There might be small debates over where dishes originate from, but ultimately it remains hard to tell, as most of these countries are rather arbitrary and actually consist of hundreds of different tribes.

- [Ghana](/food/ghana)
	- Red red and kelewele *black eyed peas in palm oil with spiced fried plantain*
	- Fufu *pounded dough from boiled cassave and plantains*
- [Nigeria](/food/nigeria)
	- Jollof and obe ata *rice and spicy red pepper sauce*
	- Ewa riso *stewed beans*

## Middle East

There is so much to write here.

Let me include Arab countries in Western Asia in the catch-all term [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East) for the sake of simplicity, though geographically inaccurate.

Some notes on historical cuisines in the Middle East, from *Cuisine and Culture* by Linda Civitello.

> The earliest Muslim recipes come from Baghdad (1226) recorded by al-Baghdadi.
> There are many *tagines*; stews of meat and fruits simmered for hours.
> For example, *mishmishiya* is made with lamb and dried apricots.
> Spices included cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, and black pepper.
> Saffron provided color.
> Ground almonds provided thickening.
> Stews were perfumed with water distilled from rose petals or orange blossoms.
>
> Milk (sheep or goat) was made into yogurt or preserved in salty cheese like feta and kasseri.
> Vegetables and pulses (e.g., aubergine and chickpeas) were puréed and mixed with garlic, lemon, salt, and sesame paste to make baba ghanoush and hummus.
> Spinach was eaten often.
> There were breads slapped onto the side of an oven called a *tannur* (like the Indian *tandoor*).
> Rice was imported from Asia and mixed with dried fruit and nuts to make pilaf.
> And they ate couscous—which today is the national dish in Northern African countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria.
> Grape leaves and aubergines were stuffed.
